    not even the most hardened criminal, becomes involved in crime purely out of a
    desire to engage in evil acts. Every criminal has an internal justification for
    getting involved in crime. A dispute over money leads someone to engage in murder,
    for instance. To the perpetrator, it is something for which there is a justification
    and which can be restated as an accomplishment of “good.” Of course, this is not
    good in a moral sense, but good in the sense of being “of benefit to oneself.”
    YOUTH: Of benefit to oneself? PHILOSOPHER: The Greek word for “good” (agathon)
    does not have a moral meaning. It just means “beneficial.” Conversely, the word
    for “evil” (kakon) means “not beneficial.” Our world is rife with injustices and
    misdeeds of all kinds, yet there is not one person who desires evil in the purest
    sense of the word, that is to say something “not beneficial.” YOUTH:'

    to be able to complete his work. According to him, his job keeps him too busy,
    and he can never find enough time to write novels, and that’s why he can’t complete
    work and enter it for writing awards. But is that the real reason? No! It’s actually
    that he wants to leave the possibility of “I can do it if I try” open, by not
    committing to anything. He doesn’t want to expose his work to criticism, and he
    certainly doesn’t want to face the reality that he might produce

    to just keep moving in a forward direction, without competing with anyone. And,
    of course, there is no need to compare oneself with others. YOUTH: No, that’s
    impossible. We’ll always compare ourselves to other people, no matter what. That’s
    exactly where our feeling of inferiority comes from, isn’t it? PHILOSOPHER: A
    healthy feeling of inferiority is not something that comes from comparing oneself
    to others; it comes from one’s comparison with one’s ideal self.'

    And saying that everyone is my responsibility. PHILOSOPHER: You must not use the
    power of anger to look away. This is a very important point. Adler never discusses
    the life tasks or life-lies in terms of good and evil. It is not morals or good
    and evil that we should be discussing, but the issue of courage. YOUTH: Courage
    again! PHILOSOPHER: Yes. Even if you are avoiding your life tasks and clinging
    to your life-lies, it isn’t because you are steeped in evil. It is not an issue
    to be condemned from a moralistic standpoint. It is only an issue of courage.'

    since it’s his task, I should just let him be? PHILOSOPHER: One has to pay attention.
    Adlerian psychology does not recommend the noninterference approach. Noninterference
    is the attitude of not knowing, and not even being interested in knowing what
    the child is doing. Instead, it is by knowing what the child is doing that one
    protects him. If it’s studying that is the issue, one tells the child that that
    is his task, and one lets him know that one is ready to assist him whenever he
    has the urge to study. But one must not intrude on the child’s task.'

    other words, no matter how much your boss tries to vent his unreasonable anger
    at you, that is not your task. The unreasonable emotions are tasks for your boss
    to deal with himself. There is no need to cozy up to him, or to yield to him to
    the point of bowing down. You should think, What I should do is face my own tasks
    in my own life without lying.

    others expect of one, or what kind of role is being demanded of one. Living as
    one likes, on the other hand, is extremely difficult. What does one want? What
    does one want to become, and what kind of life does one want to lead? One doesn’t
    always get such a concrete idea of things. It would be a grave mistake to think
    that everyone has clear-cut dreams and objectives. Don’t you know that? PHILOSOPHER:
    Maybe it is easier to live in such a way as to satisfy other people’s expectations.
    Because one is entrusting one’s own life to them. For example, one runs along
    the tracks that one’s parents have laid out. Even if there are a lot of things
    one might object to, one will not lose one’s way as long as one stays on those
    rails. But if one is deciding one’s path oneself, it’s only natural that one will
    get lost at times. One comes up against the wall of “how one should live.”'

    and a hedonist to boot. I’m past being astonished, and now I’m going to start
    laughing any moment. PHILOSOPHER: An adult, who has chosen an unfree way to live,
    on seeing a young person living freely here and now in this moment, criticizes
    the youth as being hedonistic. Of course, this is a life-lie that comes out so
    that the adult can accept his own unfree life. An adult who has chosen real freedom
    himself will not make such comments and will instead cheer on the will to be free.'

    task, and one can’t do anything about it? That I should be resigned, in an affirmative
    way? Your arguments always ignore our emotions. What does one do about all the
    anger and sadness one feels when one is taken advantage of? PHILOSOPHER: When
    one is sad, one should be sad to one’s heart’s content. It is precisely when one
    tries to escape the pain and sadness that one gets stuck and ceases to be able
    to build deep relationships with anyone. Think about it this way. We can believe.
    And we can doubt. But we are aspiring to see others as our comrades. To believe
    or to doubt—the choice should be clear.'

    self-acceptance, confidence in others, and contribution to others, in that order.
    However, these three are linked as an indispensable whole, in a sort of circular
    structure. It is because one accepts oneself just as one is—one self-accepts—that
    one can have “confidence in others” without the fear of being taken advantage
    of. And it is because one can place unconditional confidence in others, and feel
    that people are one’s comrades, that one can engage in “contribution to others.”
    Further, it is because one contributes to others that one can have the deep awareness
    that “I am of use to someone” and accept oneself just as one is. One can self-accept.
    The notes you took down the other day, do you have them with you? YOUTH: Oh, you
    mean that note on the objectives put forward by Adlerian psychology? I’ve kept
    it on me ever since that day, of course. Here it is: “The two objectives for behavior:
    to be self-reliant and to live in harmony with society. The two objectives for
    the psychology that supports these behaviors: the consciousness that I have the

    to my statement that one must not seek recognition, you said that desire for recognition
    is a universal desire. YOUTH: Yes, I did. But honestly, I’m still not entirely
    certain about this point. PHILOSOPHER: But I am sure that the reason people seek
    recognition is clear to you now. People want to like themselves. They want to
    feel that they have worth. In order to feel that, they want a feeling of contribution
    that tells them “I am of use to someone.” And they seek recognition from others
    as an easy means for gaining that feeling of contribution. YOUTH: You are saying
    that desire for recognition is a means for gaining a feeling of contribution?

    maybe the entrance examination is still far off. Maybe one is not sure what needs
    to be studied or how thoroughly, and one finds it troublesome. However, it is
    enough to do it little by little—every day one can work out some mathematical
    formulas, one can memorize some words. In short, one can dance the dance. By doing
    so, one is sure to have a sense of “this is what I did today”; this is what today,
    this single day, was for. Clearly, today is not for an entrance examination in

    is to say, a path on which you are not afraid of being disliked by others and
    you are not living others’ lives—a path that is yours alone.'

    you’re disliked or not, you pay it no mind and live free. YOUTH: If I have the
    star of contribution to others high in the sky above me, I will always have happiness
    and comrades by my side. PHILOSOPHER: Then, let’s dance in earnest the moments
    of the here and now, and live in earnest. Do not look at the past, and do not
    look at the future. One lives each complete moment like a dance. There is no need
    to compete with anyone, and one has no use for destinations. As long as you are

    indistinct outlines of the world become well defined, and even the colors are
    more vivid. Furthermore, it is not only a part of one’s visual field that becomes

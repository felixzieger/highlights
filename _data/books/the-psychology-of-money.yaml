    it up:   Having a strong sense of controlling one’s life is a more dependable
    predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions
    of life we have considered.   More than your salary. More than the size of your
    house. More than the prestige of your job. Control over doing what you want, when
    you want to, with the people you want to, is the broadest lifestyle variable that
    makes people happy.'

    hard. But doing something you love on a schedule you can’t control can feel the
    same as doing something you hate. There is a name for this feeling.

    him to tell the story about how he got rich:   I had a day job in midtown Manhattan
    paying $20 k per year—about minimum wage ... I never ate out, and never took a
    taxi. My cost of living was about $1000/month, and I was earning $1800/month.
    I did this for two years, and saved up $12,000. I was 22 years old. Once I had
    $12,000 I could quit my job and become a full-time musician. I knew I could get
    a few gigs per month to pay my cost of living. So I was free. I quit my job a
    month later, and never had a job again. When I finished telling my friend this
    story, he asked for more. I said no, that was it. He said, “No, what about when
    you sold your company?” I said no, that didn’t make a big difference in my life.
    That was just more money in the bank. The difference happened when I was 22.'

    the only way to properly deal with volatility and uncertainty—not just putting
    up with it, but realizing that it’s an admission fee worth paying. There’s no
    guarantee that it will be. Sometimes it rains at Disneyland. But if you view the
    admission fee as a fine, you’ll never enjoy the magic. Find the price, then pay
    it.

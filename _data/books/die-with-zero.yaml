    It’s a fear I heard about over and over from people who’d heard my ideas. So you’ll
    see me addressing this fear throughout the book. After all, nobody would ever
    try to die with zero if they’re afraid they’ll hit zero before they die.'

    millions or tens of millions. What then? Even if I earn enough that I could save
    up for a few extra months of life in the hospital, I can’t see the logic in doing
    that: There’s a big difference between living a life and just being kept alive,
    and I’d much rather spend on the former. So I will not work for years to save
    up for a few more months on a ventilator with a quality of life that’s close to
    zero—or, depending on the level of suffering, maybe even negative. So instead
    of engaging in “precautionary saving,” as economists call the practice, I’ll let
    the cards fall where they may. We all die sooner or later, and I’d rather die
    when the time is right than sacrifice my better years just to squeeze out a few
    more days at the tail end.'

    and to do the math to figure out how many years you need to save for. But that’s
    not the same as being so frightened of outliving your money—or of the thought
    of death—that you avoid even looking at the numbers. If you live your life with
    fear and avoidance, my bet is you will either fritter your money away or play
    it so safe that you will leave many, many years of your hard-earned money behind—so
    you’ll be working many years as a slave to your own fears.

- text: Like all living creatures, humans have evolved to survive. Of course, we want
    to do more than just survive; for example, I’m sure if I asked you if you want
    to survive or really thrive, you’d choose thriving. But our biology is such that
    efforts to live the best life we can often don’t come as naturally or as strongly
    as the basic instinct to survive. Avoiding death is our number one priority, and
    that single goal dwarfs everything else.

    inherit your money, you’re leaving the outcome to chance. I call it the three
    Rs—giving random amounts of money at a random time to random people (because who
    knows which of your heirs will still be alive by the time you die?). How can randomness
    be caring? It’s the opposite of caring: Being okay with leaving all these outcomes
    to chance means you evidently don’t care if you spend years of your life working
    for future random people, and it means you may not care how much the people closest
    to you will actually get, or when.'

    made me think: What about now? Do I want to give anything now, when they can enjoy
    those gifts more than later? My answer was yes, so I gave them that amount. In
    short, by giving the money to my kids and other people at a time when it can have
    the greatest impact on their lives, I’m making it their money, not mine. That’s
    a clear distinction, and I find it liberating: It frees me to spend to the hilt
    on myself. If I want to spend like mad, I can do it without worrying about the
    effect on my kids. They have their money to spend as they wish, and I have mine.'

    recalls his older colleague telling him, in almost a perfect echo of what Joe
    Farrell told me. “And so you shouldn’t be saving now, you should be borrowing.
    You should be living today in much the way that you’ll be living in 10 or 15 years,
    and it’s crazy to actually be scrimping and saving, which is what at least someone
    like me who was brought up in a middle-class family was taught to do.” Levitt
    says this was one of the best pieces of financial advice he ever got.

- text: 'My point—and this is important—is that the day I die and the day I stop being
    able to enjoy certain experiences are two distinctly different dates. And this
    is true for everyone. That is what I mean when I say that we die many deaths in
    the course of our lives: The teenager in you dies, the college student in you
    dies, the single unattached you dies, the version of you that’s a parent of an
    infant dies, and so on. Once each of these mini-deaths occurs, there’s no going
    back.'

- text: 'I’ve given you an impossible task: to die with zero. You can follow every
    rule in this book, you can closely track your health and life expectancy, and
    you can recalculate your financials every day—yet you’re not going to hit exactly
    zero. When you take your last breath, you might still have a few dollars in your
    pocket, and maybe even hundreds more in the bank. So technically, you will have
    failed to die with zero. That’s inevitable—and it’s okay. Why? Because that goal
    will have done its real job, of pushing you in the right direction: By aiming
    to die with zero, you will forever change your autopilot focus from earning and
    saving and maximizing your wealth to living the best life you possibly can.'

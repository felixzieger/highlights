- text: People sometimes ask my help in making big decisions. They’re usually trying
    to decide between two options. But that’s not a decision — that’s a self-created
    dilemma! You have to remember that there are always more than two options. When
    someone says they have only one option, they’re really saying, “I have no choice,”
    and you know that’s wrong. At the very least, add “do nothing” and “go insane”
    as options. When people say they have only two options, it means they got stuck.
    Once people get two options, they start comparing the pros and cons of those two,
    and forget to think of more.

    take a photo of you. He does, but when you look at the photo later, you notice
    that he took a photo of himself by mistake. Imagine you’ve got a big question
    like, “Should I quit my job and start my own company?” You go ask the advice of
    some successful people you respect. Because they can’t know everything about you
    and your unique situation, they’ll give advice that’s really just a reflection
    of their own current situation. So let’s look at some ways that advice is biased.
    Lottery numbers: When successful people give advice, I usually hear it like this:
    “Here are the lottery numbers I played: 14 29 71 33 8. They worked for me!” Success
    is based on so many factors. Some are luck. Some are not. It’s hard to know which
    are which. So which do you learn from? Underdog opinion in their context: Someone
    giving advice doesn’t want to say what’s been said too much already. But he’s
    basing that on his surroundings, not yours. So if everyone around him is quitting
    their jobs, his advice to you will be to keep your job. That advice has nothing
    to do with what’s best for you — it’s just the opinion that seems under-represented
    in his environment that day. Creative sparks: You ask, “What should I do, option
    A or B?” He replies, “Zebra!” He’s treating the situation as an invitation to
    brainstorm, giving a crazy suggestion just to open up more options. Like an Oscar
    Wilde quip, it was meant to be mostly entertaining, maybe useful, and probably
    not correct. The problem is taking any one person’s advice too seriously. Ideally,
    asking advice should be like echolocation. Bounce ideas off of all of your surroundings,
    and listen to all the echoes to get the whole picture. Ultimately, only you know
    what to do, based on all the feedback you’ve received and all your personal nuances
    that no one else knows.'

    It’s only in our imagination. All that exists is the present moment and what you
    do in it. Judge a goal by how well it changes your actions in the present moment.
    A bad goal makes you say, “I want to do that some day.” A great goal makes you
    take action immediately.

    received. People think that if they keep reading articles, browsing books, listening
    to talks, or meeting people, they’re going to suddenly get inspired. But constantly
    seeking inspiration is anti-inspiring. You have to pause the input and focus on
    your output. For every bit of inspiration you take in, use it and amplify it by
    applying it to your work. Then you’ll finally feel the inspiration you’ve been
    looking for. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out.

- text: I told my old coach that I really wanted to start my new company. He said,
    “No, you don’t.” I said, “Yes, I do! This is really important to me!” He said,
    “No, it’s not. Saying it doesn’t make it true.” I said, “You can’t ignore what
    I’m saying. I know myself well. I’m telling you what’s important to me.” He said,
    “Yes, I can ignore what you’re saying and just look at your actions. Our actions
    always reveal our real values.”

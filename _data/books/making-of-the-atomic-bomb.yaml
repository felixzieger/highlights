    You cannot have the one without the other; the one depends upon the other. Nor
    can you have only benevolent knowledge; the scientific method doesn’t filter for
    benevolence. Knowledge has consequences, not always intended, not always comfortable,
    not always welcome. The earth revolves around the sun, not the sun around the
    earth. “It is a profound and necessary truth,” Robert Oppenheimer would say, “that

    many of his colleagues—the particulate theory of matter was an English invention
    more than a Continental, and its faintly Britannic odor made it repulsive to the
    xenophobic German nose—but if atoms did exist he was sure they could not be mechanical.
    “It is of paramount importance,” he confessed in his Scientific Autobiography,
    “that the outside world is something independent from man, something absolute,
    and the quest for laws which apply to this absolute appeared to me as the most
    sublime scientific pursuit in life.” Of all the laws of physics, Planck believed
    that the thermodynamic laws applied most basically to the independent “outside
    world” that his need for an absolute required.88 He saw early that purely mechanical
    atoms violated the second law of thermodynamics. His choice was clear.

    long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the

    . . . what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because
    almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the

    from his master. At the same time he learned to trust his own judgment: he learned
    the possibility and the necessity of dissent.'

    classical physics had claimed for itself. “Physics concerns what we can say about
    nature.”

    the hardware of the war, the tools. But they were only proximately the mechanism
    of the slaughter. The ultimate mechanism was a method of organization—anachronistically
    speaking, a software package.376 “The basic lever,” the writer Gil Elliot comments,
    “was the conscription law, which made vast numbers of men available for military
    service.377 The civil machinery which ensured the carrying out of this law, and
    the military organization which turned numbers of men into battalions and divisions,
    were each founded on a bureaucracy. The production of resources, in particular
    guns and ammunition, was a matter for civil organization. The movement of men
    and resources to the front, and the trench system of defence, were military concerns.”

    paranoid. In scientific work, creative thinking demands seeing things not seen
    previously, or in ways not previously imagined; and this necessitates jumping
    off from “normal” positions, and taking risks by departing from reality. The difference
    between the thinking of the paranoid patient and the scientist comes from the
    latter’s ability and willingness to test out his fantasies or grandiose conceptualizations
    through the systems of checks and balances science has established—and to give
    up those schemes that are shown not to be valid on the basis of these scientific
    checks. It is specifically because science provides such a framework of rules
    and regulations to control and set bounds to paranoid thinking that a scientist
    can feel comfortable about taking the paranoid leaps. Without this structuring,
    the threat of such unrealistic, illogical, and even bizarre thinking to overall
    thought and personality organization in general would be too great to permit the
    scientist the freedom of such fantasying.

    had not planned to ask for money. “The diversion of Government funds for such
    purposes as ours appears to be hardly possible,” he explained to Pegram the next
    day, “and I have therefore myself avoided to make any such recommendation.”1238
    But Teller answered Hoover promptly, probably speaking for Fermi: “For the first
    year of this research we need six thousand dollars, mostly in order to buy the
    graphite.” (“My friends blamed me because the great enterprise of nuclear energy
    was to start with such a pittance,” Teller reminisces; “they haven’t forgiven
    me yet.”1239 Szilard, who would write Briggs on October 26 that the graphite alone
    for a largescale experiment would cost at least $33,000, must have been appalled.1240)
    Adamson had anticipated just such a raid on the public treasury. “At this point,”
    says Szilard, “the representative of the Army started a rather longish tirade”:
    He told us that it was naive to believe that we could make a significant contribution
    to defense by creating a new weapon. He said that if a new weapon is created,
    it usually takes two wars before one can know whether the weapon is any good or
    not. Then he explained rather laboriously that it is in the end not weapons which
    win the wars, but the morale of the troops. He went on in this vein for a long
    time until suddenly Wigner, the most polite of us, interrupted him. [Wigner] said
    in his high-pitched voice that it was very interesting for him to hear this. He
    always thought that weapons were very important and that this is what costs money,
    and this is why the Army needs such a large appropriation. But he was very interested
    to hear that he was wrong: it’s not weapons but the morale which wins the wars.
    And if this is correct, perhaps one should take a second look at the budget of
    the Army, and maybe the budget could be cut.'

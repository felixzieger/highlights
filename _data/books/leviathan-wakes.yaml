    his problem, turning it one way and then the other, not even looking for an answer.
    It was a simple mental exercise. Look at the facts without judgment: Havelock
    was an Earther. Havelock was in a portside bar again and looking for a fight.
    Havelock was his partner. Statement after statement, fact after fact, facet after
    facet. He didn’t try to put them in order or make some kind of narrative out of
    them; that would all come later. Now it was enough to wash the day’s cases out
    of his head and get ready for the immediate situation. By the time the tube reached
    his station, he felt centered. Like he was walking on his whole foot, was how
    he’d described it, back when he had anyone to describe it to.'

    got to stop pretending. All the years he’d told himself that he was respected,
    that he was good at his job, that all his sacrifices had been made for a reason
    fell away and left him with the clear, unmuddied knowledge that he was a functional
    alcoholic who had pared away everything good in his own life to make room for
    anesthetic. Shaddid thought he was a joke. Muss thought he was the price she paid
    not to sleep with someone she didn’t like. The only one who might have any respect
    for him at all was Havelock, an Earther. It was peaceful, in its way. He could
    stop making the effort to keep up appearances. If he stayed in bed listening to
    the alarm drone, he was just living up to expectations. No shame in that.

    and it meant different things every time. Neural regrowth hormone? Posthuman.
    Sex robots with inbuilt pseudo intelligence? Posthuman. Self-optimizing network
    routing? Posthuman. It was a word from advertising copy, breathless and empty,
    and all he’d ever thought it really meant was that the people using it had a limited
    imagination about what exactly humans were capable of.

    Belt and the inner planets was something besides politics and resource management.
    He knew as well as anyone that the Belt offered a harder, more dangerous life
    than Mars or Earth provided. And yet it called these people—the best people—out
    of humanity’s gravity wells to cast themselves into the darkness. The impulse
    to explore, to stretch, to leave home. To go as far as possible out into the universe

    probably. They had a culture of making do, surviving on scraps, living on the
    bleeding edge of their resources. But in the end, without Earth, everything would
    eventually die. Humans had been out of the gravity well a long time. Long enough
    to have developed the technology to cut that umbilical cord, but they’d just never
    bothered to do it. Stagnant. Humanity, for all its desire to fling itself into
    every livable pocket it could reach, had become stagnant. Satisfied to fly around
    in ships built half a century before, using technology that hadn’t changed in
    longer than that.

    happen,” she said. “No one ever does. And, look, you don’t have to do this alone,”
    he said.

    the credit.” “The Belter who went back into Eros of his own free will in order
    to save Earth? You’re damn right I’m going to tell them about him.” “Not ‘the
    Belter.’ Him. Josephus Aloisus Miller.” Holden had stopped eating the free strawberries.
    Fred crossed his arms. “You’ve been reading up,” Fred said. “Yeah. Well. I didn’t
    know him all that well.” “Neither did anybody else,” Fred said, and then softened
    a little. “I know it’s hard, but we don’t need a real man with a complex life.
    We need a symbol of the Belt. An icon.” “Sir,” the secretary said. “We really
    do need to go now.” “That’s what got us here,” Holden said. “Icons. Symbols. People
    without names. All of those Protogen scientists were thinking about biomass and
    populations. Not Mary who worked in supply and raised flowers in her spare time.
    None of them killed her.”

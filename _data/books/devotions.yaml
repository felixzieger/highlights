- text: THE GIFT Be still, my soul, and steadfast. Earth and heaven both are still
    watching though time is draining from the clock and your walk, that was confident
    and quick, has become slow. So, be slow if you must, but let the heart still play
    its true part. Love still as once you loved, deeply and without patience. Let
    God and the world know you are grateful. That the gift has been given.

    forever.

- text: There is a sense among parents that kids should have limits set on things
    they want, because they want it and regardless of what that thing is. I call this
    sense that it is wrong for a child to satisfy their wants the Greedy Child Fallacy.

    to tell us how their algorithms are fundamentally different from all of these
    prior advances in persuasion. Tech’s critics like to say it’s the sheer number
    of users, or the precision of the fine-tuning, or that it’s embedded in our devices,
    or that the algorithms are designed from psychological research. But the question
    remains: At what point do any of these features suddenly take control of our minds
    and actions?'

- text: Boredom is bad for the same reasons pain is bad. Both indicate suffering.
    Both indicate a problem that needs solving. And neither is a virtue in its own
    right. We wouldn’t arbitrarily expose a child to pain with the argument that pain
    is an inevitable part of life that they need to “learn to deal with.” Such cruelty
    teaches children that, not only are we indifferent to their suffering, but they
    should accept their suffering as well. Instead, when a child comes to us in pain,
    we always investigate why, partly for our own peace of mind, but also to give
    the child context to understand the pain. When we ourselves understand that the
    injury is minor, we explain to the child that it will heal, and this understanding
    is soothing. And of course we take a few steps to mitigate the pain and prevent
    it from happening again. We should apply the same basic process for all suffering,
    including boredom. All suffering is caused by some form of ignorance, and it can
    be mitigated and outright prevented by some form of knowledge. All of parenting
    can be summarized as supplying the child with the knowledge to reduce their own
    suffering.

- text: Rules and limits are often enforced to “make kids understand” certain hard
    truths about the world, such as that you can’t always get what you want, or that
    life isn’t fair. In reality, rule enforcement can’t teach about the world. As
    we’ve already seen, the enforcement of rules and limitations diverts the focus
    away from the problem itself and toward the parent and whatever contrived consequences
    the parent is willing to impose. Rules are confusing.

- text: 'The goal is for children to be free of limitations set upon them by external
    “authorities” of knowledge. But that’s not to say we pretend they are totally
    free from constraints. We want them to operate within the constraints of the natural
    world. Indeed, they have no choice but to accept gravity and the hardness of concrete.
    And we want them to operate within some of the constraints of the interpersonal
    world. Specifically, there are two kinds of good interpersonal constraints: Other
    people’s boundaries. We don’t want kids to think they can demand anything they
    want from others. Constraints that they accept voluntarily, such as the rules
    of a game or conventions of politeness. In general, we want kids to understand
    the natural world, to respect other people’s boundaries, and to accept the interpersonal
    constraints they understand, and reject those that they don’t.'

- text: The real question for parents transitioning to no rules is not if, but when.
    Is a sudden change at eighteen years old really a good idea? It’s relatively common
    for even the most seemingly well-adjusted college freshman to fall apart in some
    way, drop out, and think themselves to have started real life as a failure, saddled
    with debt and disappointment. Relative to this dramatic phase change that we all
    take for granted, is it so radical to wean a child off of rules completely prior
    to leaving the home?

- text: Human knowledge growth is likewise the story of solving an endless sequence
    of problems through a process of variation and selection. But with human knowledge,
    the problems are not limited to survival—they can be about anything, either in
    the real world or imagined. And instead of mutation, the engine of variation is
    conjecture, or creative guesswork. Selection consists of, first, criticizing all
    of our candidate guesses and, second, choosing only the guess that seems to work
    best. Often, this involves actually trying out the guess in the real world to
    see if it solves the problem in question.

- text: Taking Children Seriously is simply the recognition that, in the realm of
    parenting, the source of knowledge does not determine its validity, that knowledge
    does not require authoritarian justification. On the contrary, knowledge creation
    is an entirely egalitarian enterprise—anyone’s conjecture might solve the problem
    at hand, anyone’s criticism might be reason to choose one path over another. Kids’
    ideas are just as valid as adults’, and they should be taken seriously and accounted
    for in any solution to any conflict.

- text: The bucket theory of knowledge isn’t just partially wrong, it is completely
    wrong. All new knowledge comes from within and none from without. Knowledge is
    always created, never consumed. Therefore, creativity is central to all understanding.

    possible transformation means that we can impact anything and everything we care
    about for the better, from home life to the subcultures to which we belong to
    how we organize society. It’s not wishful thinking to say that our choices and
    values must account for the existence of people more so than any other living
    thing. For instance, if we develop moon colonies, we can easily keep dolphins
    out of it. But there is no way to keep the actions of earthbound people out of
    it. A single person down on earth could develop any number of things that affect
    the moon colony, such as a new political theory, or a new technology, or a new
    form of entertainment. If you care about something, you must also care about people,
    because people will think up things that could come to affect it. Knowledge creators
    have consequences for the entire universe, and that gives us cosmic significance.
    Since children are fully capable of creating knowledge, they are full-status people
    who are just as cosmically significant as adults.

- text: Despite our ancestors’ pervasive efforts to stifle innovation, ancient people
    eventually formed cities, achieved technological successes, and established institutions
    such as mature religions, nation-states, and sophisticated traditions of language
    and art. But even then, the dominant mode of knowledge transfer focused on preservation
    and stasis rather than improvement and dynamism. Early civilizations thought that
    all knowledge came from the past, a fixed quantity that could only decay over
    generations if the people weren’t too careful. The present time was always considered
    a Fallen Age.

    if they get enjoyment out of solving their own problems in their own way and orient
    themselves toward interests that don’t conform with the majority, then this will
    need to be driven (often beaten) out of them. This may explain why many adults
    are so quick to crack down on things that kids find particularly enjoyable. Having
    an outsized amount of fun almost universally signals a straying from the static
    norms. Conformity is almost never wildly fun. This is especially true when the
    source of enjoyment is new, such as a novel form of food, technology, or media.
    A simple rule of stasis is to be watchful and stamp out excessive enjoyment among
    children.

    for the modern world. Education could focus on real-world training around genuine
    interests in a way that is guided by providing value to others. College graduates,
    on the other hand, often enter adulthood hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.
    This debt forces them to narrow their options to uninspiring jobs rather than
    taking risks on starting new ventures that might solve problems in novel ways
    and raise the prosperity of everyone. Instead, college graduates are incentivized
    to play it safe, to never experiment, and to accept a middling quality of life.
    This overall outlook—a life of low expectations, where the main virtues are persistence
    and conformity rather than dynamism—gets passed onto their children as a tragic
    holdover from the static societies of yesteryear.

    run out the drain instantly, even if you open the drain all the way. The tub can’t
    fill up immediately, even with the inflow faucet on full blast. A

    that last ten times as long make the GNP go down. GNP is a measure of throughput—flows
    of stuff made and purchased in a year—rather than capital stocks, the houses and
    cars and computers and stereos that are the source of real wealth and real pleasure.
    It could be argued that the best society would be one in which capital stocks
    can be and used with the lowest possible throughput, rather than the highest.
    Although there is every reason to want a thriving economy, there is no particular
    reason to want the GNP to go up. But governments around the world respond to a
    signal of faltering GNP by taking numerous actions to keep it growing

    in legend: the silver bullet; the trimtab; the miracle cure; the secret passage;
    the magic password; the single hero who turns the tide of history; the nearly
    effortless way to cut through or leap over huge obstacles.'

    at any point above that point the tenant is being screwed and at any point below
    that you are being screwed. In fact, there is a large gray area in which both
    you and the tenant are getting a good, or at least a fair, deal. Stop worrying
    and get on with your life.”

    because slowing them gives the many balancing loops, through technology and markets
    and other forms of adaptation (all of which have limits and delays), time to function.
    It’s the same as slowing the car when you’re driving too fast, rather than calling
    for more responsive brakes or technical advances in steering.

    development—in some of the houses the meter was installed in the basement; in
    others it was installed in the front hall. With no other differences in the houses,
    electricity consumption was 30 percent lower in the houses where the meter was
    in the highly visible location in the front hall. I love that story because it’s
    an example of a high leverage point in the information structure of the system.

    measure is more important than what we can’t measure. Think about that for a minute.
    It means that we make quantity more important than quality. If quantity forms
    the goals of our feedback loops, if quantity is the center of our attention and
    language and institutions, if we motivate ourselves, rate ourselves, and reward
    ourselves on our ability to produce quantity, then quantity will be the result.
    You can look around and make up your own mind about whether quantity or quality
    is the outstanding characteristic of the world in which you live.

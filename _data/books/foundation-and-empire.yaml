    case,” said Barr, with soft emphasis, “I could not begin better than by informing
    you regretfully that I am not in the possession of love charms, potions, or philtres.
    Nor am I in the least capable of influencing the favors of any young lady as may
    appeal to you.” “I have no need of artificial aids in that respect, sir.” The
    complacency undeniably present in the general’s voice was stirred with amusement.
    “Do you receive many requests for such commodities?” “Enough. Unfortunately, an
    uninformed public tends to confuse scholarship with magicianry, and love life
    seems to be that factor which requires the largest quantity of magical tinkering.”

    Riose was violent again. “It was not a matter of telling me. The officials said
    nothing. They spoke business exclusively. But I spoke to ordinary men. I absorbed
    the ideas of the common folk; their ‘manifest destiny,’ their calm acceptance
    of a great future. It is a thing that can’t be hidden; a universal optimism they
    don’t even try to hide.”

    of error are greater, it is only because history does not deal with as many humans
    as physics does atoms, so that individual variations count for more.

    to seize Randu’s wrist, “Our few survivors have reported the Mule’s poss … enemy’s
    possession of a new weapon. A nuclear-field depressor.” “A what?” Ovall said,
    “Most of our ships were lost because their nuclear weapons failed them. It could
    not have happened by either accident or sabotage. It must have been a weapon of
    the Mule. It didn’t work perfectly; the effect was intermittent; there were ways
    to neutralize—my dispatches are not detailed. But you see that such a tool would
    change the nature of war and, possibly, make our entire fleet obsolete.”

    well known to the intelligentsia, literati, and just-plain-well-read of the Foundation.
    Its notable characteristics depended, subjectively, upon the source material that
    was read. To a thoughtful biographer, it was the “symbolization of a retreat from
    a nonacademic reality,” a society columnist gushed silkily at its “frightfully
    masculine atmosphere of careless disorder,” a University Ph.D. called it brusquely,
    “bookish, but unorganized,” a nonuniversity friend said, “good for a drink anytime
    and you can put your feet on the sofa,” and a breezy newsweekly broadcast, that
    went in for color, spoke of the “rocky, down-to-earth, no-nonsense living quarters
    of blaspheming, Leftish, balding Ebling Mis.”

    provisions for the Mule. Maybe he didn’t guarantee our victory. But, then, neither
    did he guarantee defeat. He’s just out of the game and we’re on our own. The Mule
    can be licked.” “How?” “By the only way anyone can be licked—by attacking in strength
    at weakness.

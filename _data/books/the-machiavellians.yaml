- text: He makes his critique of historical monism in order to break down abstract
    approaches to history, to do away with preconceptions of how things ought to be,
    and to force a concrete examination of the facts in each specific problem rather
    than an adjustment of the facts to fit the requirements of some schematic theory.
    Monistic theories of history, he believes, are a great obstacle to a recognition
    of the facts.

    classes. Unfortunately for these great thinkers, things do not happen in this
    way; violence does not diminish in the proportion that it should diminish

    given and suffered tomorrow. A doctor who denied the reality of germs would not
    thereby lessen the destructive effect of germs on the human body. In politics
    those magical attitudes which medicine has left behind still prevail. It is still
    firmly believed that by denying the social role of violence, violence is thus
    somehow overcome.

    of his masterpiece, Political Parties,[*] “makes no attempt to offer a ‘new system.’
    It is not the principal aim of science to create systems, but rather to promote
    understanding. It is not the purpose of sociological science to discover, or rediscover,
    solutions, since numerous problems of the individual life and the life of social
    groups are not capable of ‘solution’ at all, but must ever remain ‘open.’

    his power, he further made that sovereignty the theoretical basis of all his practical
    activities. He made himself popular in France by declaring that he regarded himself
    as merely the executive organ of the collective will manifested in the elections,
    and that he was entirely at the disposition of that will, prepared in all things
    to accept its decisions. With great shrewdness, he continually repeated that he
    was no more than an instrument, a creature of the masses.”

    circumstances: when his action is motivated by a deliberately held goal or purpose;
    when that goal is possible; when the steps or means he takes to reach the goal
    are in fact appropriate for reaching it.'

    another field of human interest, other than social affairs, has uniformly resulted
    in human triumphs with respect to those fields. In every field, science has solved
    relevant problems; indeed, science is in one sense merely the systematic method
    for solving relevant problems.

- text: Those who have privileges almost always develop false or distorted ideas about
    themselves. They are under a compulsion to deceive themselves as well as others
    through some kind of irrational theory which will seek to justify their monopoly
    of those privileges, rather than to explain the annoying truths about

- text: A dilemma confronts any section of the élite that tries to act scientifically.
    The political life of the masses and the cohesion of society demand the acceptance
    of myths. A scientific attitude toward society does not permit belief in the truth
    of the myths. But the leaders must profess, indeed foster, belief in the myths,
    or the fabric of society will crack and they be overthrown. In short, the leaders,
    if they themselves are scientific, must lie. It is hard to lie all the time in
    public but to keep privately an objective regard for the truth. Not only is it
    hard; it is often ineffective, for lies are often not convincing when told with
    a divided heart. The tendency is for the deceivers to become self-deceived, to
    believe their own myths. When this happens, they are no longer scientific. Sincerity
    is bought at the price of truth.

    in New England and built a railroad across a continent, in the days of the first
    steel rails. His railroad still stood; his battle to build it had dissolved into
    a legend, because people preferred not to understand it or to believe it possible.

    than he had received it. Throughout the generations, that disgrace had not come.

    “Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which
    can’t exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money
    is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another
    must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers,
    who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force.
    Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider

    are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect you against them. But

    inherited, shared, looted or obtained as a favor. Americans were the first to

    judgment of me. That woman and all those like her keep evading the thoughts which

    believe to be evil. They do it, because they want to avoid effort. You do it,
    because you won’t permit yourself to consider anything that would spare you. They
    indulge their emotions at any cost. You sacrifice your emotions as the first cost
    of any problem. They are willing to bear nothing. You are willing to bear anything.
    They keep evading responsibility. You keep assuming it. But don’t you see that
    the essential error is the same? Any refusal to recognize reality, for any reason
    whatever, has disastrous consequences. There are no evil thoughts except one:
    the refusal to think. Don’t ignore your own desires, Mr. Rearden. Don’t sacrifice

    get from me—not by your suffering or mine. I don’t accept sacrifices and I don’t
    make them. If you asked me for more than you meant to me, I would refuse. If you
    asked me to give up the railroad, I’d leave you. If ever the pleasure of one has

    He thought of his children. He had a son in high school and a daughter, nineteen,
    of whom he was fiercely, painfully proud, because she was recognized as the most
    beautiful girl in town. He asked himself whether he could deliver his children
    to the fate of the children of the unemployed, as he had seen them in the blighted
    areas, in the settlements around closed factories and along the tracks of discontinued
    railroads. He saw, in astonished horror, that the choice which he now had to make
    was between the lives of his children and the lives of the passengers on the Comet.
    A conflict of this kind had never been possible before. It was by protecting the
    safety of the passengers that he had earned the security of his children; he had
    served one by serving the other; there had been no clash of interests, no call
    for victims. Now, if he wanted to save the passengers, he had to do it at the
    price of his children. He remembered dimly the sermons he had heard about the
    beauty of self-immolation, about the virtue of sacrificing to others that which
    was one’s dearest. He knew nothing about the philosophy of ethics; but he knew
    suddenly—not in words, but in the form of a dark, angry, savage pain—that if this

    a smile, a smile substituting for a moan of understanding, amusement and pain.
    He asked, his voice gravely gentle, “Do you think that you can still serve him—that

    will stop on the day when you’ll discover that your work has been placed in the

    He added, “Why should you be astonished? You said that we were of his kind once,
    you and I. We still are. But one of us has betrayed him.” “Yes,” she said sternly,
    “one of us has. We cannot serve him by renunciation.” “We cannot serve him by
    making terms with his destroyers.” “I’m not making terms with them. They need

    in which they gain benefits in exchange for harming you?” “If I can keep Taggart

    meeting to discover that we had become beggars—rotten, whining, sniveling beggars,
    all of us, because no man could claim his pay as his rightful earning, he had
    no rights and no earnings, his work didn’t belong to him, it belonged to ’.the
    family,‘. and they owed him nothing in return, and the only claim he had on them
    was his ’.need’ -so he had to beg in public for relief from his needs, like any
    lousy moocher, listing all his troubles and miseries, down to his patched drawers
    and his wife’s head colds, hoping that .‘the family’ would throw him the alms.
    He had to claim miseries, because it’s miseries, not work, that had become the
    coin of the realm—so it turned into a contest among six thousand panhandlers,
    each claiming that his need was worse than his brother’s

    your life belongs to God and those who claimed that it belongs to your neighbors—between
    those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for the sake of ghosts in heaven
    and those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for the sake of incompetents

    a blob of color; by integrating the evidence of his sight and his touch, he learns

    he learns that the table is made of wood; he learns that the wood consists of
    cells, that the cells consist of molecules, that the molecules consist of atoms.
    All through this process, the work of his mind consists of answers to a single
    question: What is it? His means to establish the truth of his answers is logic,
    and logic rests on the axiom that existence exists. Logic is the art of non-contradictory
    identification. A contradiction cannot exist. An atom is itself, and so is the
    universe; neither can contradict its own identity; nor can a part contradict the
    whole. No concept man forms is valid unless he integrates it without contradiction
    into the total sum of his knowledge.'

    suspension of one’s consciousness, the refusal to think—not blindness, but the
    refusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know. It is the act of unfocusing
    your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility of judgment—on
    the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuse to identify
    it, that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the verdict ‘It is.’

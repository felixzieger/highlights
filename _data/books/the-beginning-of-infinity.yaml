- text: The ability to create and use explanatory knowledge gives people a power to
    transform nature which is ultimately not limited by parochial factors, as all
    other adaptations are, but only by universal laws. This is the cosmic significance
    of explanatory knowledge – and hence of people, whom I shall henceforward define
    as entities that can create explanatory knowledge.

    have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a state without
    creative thought. Its other name is death.'

    creating knowledge is biological evolution.

- text: Thus there is a class of high-level phenomena – including the liquidity of
    water and the relationship between containers, heating elements, boiling and bubbles
    – that can be well explained in terms of each other alone, with no direct reference
    to anything at the atomic level or below. In other words, the behaviour of that
    whole class of high-level phenomena is quasi-autonomous – almost self-contained.
    This resolution into explicability at a higher, quasi-autonomous level is known
    as emergence.

    must have enough functionality to keep the organism alive, and to pass all the

- text: No good explanation can predict the outcome, or the probability of an outcome,
    of a phenomenon whose course is going to be significantly affected by the creation
    of new knowledge. This is a fundamental limitation on the reach of scientific
    prediction, and, when planning for the future, it is vital to come to terms with
    it. Following Popper, I shall use the term prediction for conclusions about future
    events that follow from good explanations, and prophecy for anything that purports
    to know what is not yet knowable.

    we solve certain problems in time, we are doomed. But that has always been true,
    and always will be. Problems are inevitable.

    and I would say that they know it. But to them, no matter how good an explanation
    it is, and no matter how true and important and useful it may be, they still do
    not consider it to be knowledge. It is only if a god then comes along and reassures
    them that it is true (or if they imagine such a god or other authority) that they
    count it as knowledge. So, to them it does count as a revelation if the authority
    tells them what they are already fully aware of.

- text: creating a good explanation is hard not because of what anyone has decided,
    but because there is an objective reality that does not meet anyone’s prior expectations,
    including those of authorities. The creators of bad explanations such as myths
    are indeed just making things up. But the method of seeking good explanations
    creates an engagement with reality, not only in science, but in good philosophy
    too – which is why it works, and why it is the antithesis of concocting stories
    to meet made-up criteria.

- text: 'Another misconception to which the idea of decision-making by weighing sometimes
    leads is that problems can be solved by weighing – in particular, that disputes
    between advocates of rival explanations can be resolved by creating a weighted
    average of their proposals. But the fact is that a good explanation, being hard
    to vary at all without losing its explanatory power, is hard to mix with a rival
    explanation: something halfway between them is usually worse than either of them
    separately. Mixing two explanations to create a better explanation requires an
    additional act of creativity. That is why good explanations are discrete – separated
    from each other by bad explanations – and why, when choosing between explanations,
    we are faced with discrete options.'

  page: Page 427
- text: It is a mistake to conceive of choice and decision-making as a process of
    selecting from existing options according to a fixed formula. That omits the most
    important element of decision-making, namely the creation of new options.

    made creatively. That is to say, they emerge from individual minds as novel ideas,

    evolution. It is creativity by a heroic inventor.
  page: Page 475
- text: Meme evolution took place, and, like all evolution, this was always in the
    direction of greater faithfulness. This meant becoming ever more anti-rational.
    At some point, meme evolution achieved static societies – presumably they were
    tribes. Consequently, all those increases in creativity never produced streams
    of innovations. Innovation remained imperceptibly slow, even as the capacity for
    it was increasing rapidly.

- text: Perhaps a more practical way of stressing the same truth would be to frame
    the growth of knowledge (all knowledge, not only scientific) as a continual transition
    from problems to better problems, rather than from problems to solutions or from
    theories to better theories.

- text: Horgan wrote that he had originally believed science to be ‘open-ended, even
    infinite’. But he became convinced of the contrary by (what I would call) a series
    of misconceptions and bad arguments. His basic misconception was empiricism. He
    believed that what distinguishes science from unscientific fields such as literary
    criticism, philosophy or art is that science has the ability to ‘resolve questions’
    objectively (by comparing theories with reality), while other fields can produce
    only multiple, mutually incompatible interpretations of any issue. He was mistaken
    in both respects. As I have explained throughout this book, there is objective
    truth to be found in all those fields, while

    like to see humanity believing math is good. Believing generating nuclear power
    is good. Believing getting to Mars is good. Believing expanding is good.

- text: Mortality is the main source of scarcity. If we had more time (or infinite
    time), we would be less concerned with whether something was faster. The reason
    speed has value is because time has value; the reason time has value is because
    human life spans are finite.

- text: In 2009, it would have been remarkable to claim “$100 billion in equity value
    is being held back by outdated taxi and hotel regulations.” Uber and Airbnb showed
    it was true. The “next big thing” was being held back by those eighty-year-old
    regulations. Very, very few people were thinking about them. These things are
    so remarkable and hard to understand that they go unseen constantly.
  page: Page 33
- text: A philosopher named Frederic Bastiat has a parable about this, about what
    is seen and what is unseen. It requires more empathy and more imagination to think
    about value that isn’t seen. You can see a skyscraper. You can’t see what could
    have been built but wasn’t. You can’t see the cities we could build if we had
    regulations allowing skyscrapers to be built in two weeks rather than two years.

- text: The movie Limitless is about a guy who finds a wonder drug that unlocks the
    use of our fullest intelligence. There are side effects, but the movie is so refreshing
    because, at the end, the guy works out the bugs. With his super intelligence,
    he’s able to figure out the better version of the pill. That’s how it works in
    real life. We aren’t like Icarus. We had some crashes, but we figured out how
    to have safe, reliable planes stay up in the sky. We engineered the failures away.
    We figured out a way around the seemingly un-figure-out-able. Believing the next
    problem is solvable is a fundamental tenet of the philosophy of technology.

- text: The issue that stems from abstraction is people get alienated from complexity
    and start to believe things are easy. That’s just humans being humans. Actually,
    putting all those things behind an easy interface is ridiculously hard. It’s really,
    really, really hard to do. It’s really hard to make something easy.

- text: Feudalism was enforced by knights on horseback in shining armor with heavy
    swords; guns changed that. Guns reduced the importance of physical inequality.
    Any man (or importantly, woman) with a gun could kill any other man, even if the
    shooter was old and frail and the shootee was Sir Lancelot himself. Guns destabilized
    the feudal hierarchy; a strong right arm was suddenly worth less than a strong
    left brain, because the technology and supply chain to produce muskets was suddenly
    critical. The gun helped catalyze the transition from feudal

- text: It’s not so much that decentralization is a panacea. It’s that when you are
    over-centralized, you decentralize. And then, if people over-decentralize, they
    recentralize—but around new hubs each time. So it’s bundling, unbundling, then
    rebundling.

- text: They didn’t understand programmability, permissionlessness, or peer-to-peer,
    and they overestimated the robustness of legacy institutions. History repeats
    with crypto. Crypto is more than an asset class because it transforms the custody,
    trading, issuance, governance, and programmability of anything scarce. It’s a
    new financial system, not just some ticker symbols.

- text: On disk → Online → On-chain. On-chain is like the third level of deployment.
    Files that only you care about stay on your local disk. Files that are important
    to others get put online. And files that are *really* important to others will
    get put on the blockchain. When you put information online, you get distribution,
    sharing, collaboration, etc. When you put it on-chain, you get immutability, verifiability,
    monetization, etc. On-chain is not suitable for everything, just like you don’t
    put everything online.

- text: We should prioritize this because life extension makes everything relatively
    cheaper. If a purchase used to cost you $100 and now costs you $1, that purchase
    takes 100x less time from your life because your working life produced that $100
    or $1 by trading your time. Rather than spending, say, one hundred minutes of
    your life, you spent one minute. Life extension, or reversing aging, is the ultimate
    scarcity reduction. It gives everybody lots of time.

- text: The opinions of others are imperfect proxies for analyzing the data yourself.
    The more technical knowledge you have in an area, the less you need to rely on
    reputational signals. A few scientists publish a study; a few dozen people summarize
    it; a few million read the summaries. Then everyone argues with each other. Most
    of the nodes involved in that scenario are signal repeaters. What actually matters
    for determining truth are signal sources. Signal repeaters are valuable because
    they bring items to your attention. Sometimes their summaries are even reliable.
    But the truth is upstream.

    or Israeli, Democrat or Republican. There’s actually no contention over who owns
    what Bitcoin, which is amazing, because it’s a trillion-dollar piece of international
    property. That’s the kind of thing people usually fight over. That says something.

- text: Progress is doing some math today and doing some more math in the same area
    tomorrow. A little bit of compounding progress along the same direction each day
    adds up to something, but time spent on these sites add up to nothing. I’m not
    saying they have zero value; there’s some value to serendipity. You do learn the
    pulse of what a community is thinking. But I think we are overconsuming novelty
    and underconsuming purpose.

- text: The time selects for the technology, and the technology selects for the ideology.
    The era of centralized technology had mass production and mass media. The political
    ideologies enabled by those technologies were Communism, Nazism, and Democratic
    Capitalism. For the past hundred years, they slugged it out.

    that underpins all narratives.

    for them: who did Steve Jobs steal all the iPhones from? If wealth is a zero-sum
    game, where one person’s gain is someone else’s loss, where did the phones come
    from? This simple example shows wealth can be created. A surprising number of
    people seem to believe profit is a function of sufficient malevolence. Wealth
    creation always attracts entitled predators.'

- text: Money seems to be locally zero-sum (after a trade happens, Person A has –$1,
    Person B has +$1), but actually money is globally positive-sum. In a voluntary
    exchange, A and B both gain in wealth because they both get non-monetary benefit
    from making the trade.

- text: Over time, competitors with higher-quality products arose, and regulations
    effectively criminalized the sale of beta-quality products. Barriers to entry
    rose, increasing the capital required to challenge incumbents. In these industries,
    starting a company in your garage became much more difficult.

- text: These pioneers had some time before competitors and regulations created barriers
    to entry. The messy process of innovation resulted in many deaths from refinery
    fires, railroad collisions, car explosions, airplane crashes, and drug overdoses.
    At first, this was accepted as the price of progress. Over time, competitors with
    higher-quality products arose, and regulations effectively criminalized the sale
    of beta-quality products. Barriers

    didn’t get three billion people to agree to make a twenty-year-old kid a CEO.
    Every single piece of support—an employee, a user, a customer buying ads, a backlink—he
    acquired over time. This was a series of one-to-one transactions where he gave
    each of them more than they’d gotten before, making mutually beneficial trades.

    and competent. The bureaucrat is selected by election, and the dictator is selected
    by power, but neither is selected for competence. The selection mechanism really,
    really matters because it is not simply the current state of the system but how
    that state was achieved that is important for leaders to understand. People tend
    to think an institution will endure just because it has so far.

- text: In the early days of a startup, the most important number is the burn rate.
    Every single person must be indispensable. Eventually, if successful, the company
    starts building up some structure. Conservatism takes over. With the business
    growing consistently, the founder adds structure, career tracks, and a stable
    hierarchy. The new important measure becomes the “bus number,” the number of people
    who can get hit by a bus with the company still remaining functional. Suddenly,
    every single person must now be dispensable.

- text: Venture capital has many, many faults. But there are a couple interesting
    things about it. One of the biggest is VCs are very interested in whether they
    were wrong. If they pass on companies that become successful, they want to understand
    why they were wrong. They want to admit they were wrong and potentially invest
    in them now. They have financial incentive for discovering truth, which is uncommon.

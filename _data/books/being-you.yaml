- text: One of the more beautiful things about the scientific method is that it is
    cumulative and incremental. Today, many of us can understand things that would
    have seemed entirely incomprehensible even in principle to our ancestors, maybe
    even to scientists and philosophers working just a few decades ago. Over time,
    mystery 20after mystery has yielded to the systematic application of reason and
    experiment. If we take mysterianism as a serious option we might as well all give
    up and go home. So, let’s not.

- text: The real problem accepts that conscious experiences exist and focuses primarily
    on their phenomenological properties.

- text: The fatal flaw of vitalism was to interpret a failure of imagination as an
    insight into necessity. This is the same flaw that lies at the heart of the zombie
    argument.

- text: Equally important, it pushes back against the limiting idea that consciousness
    is just ‘one thing’ – a single intimidating mystery that might elude scientific
    explanation altogether. We will instead see how different properties of consciousness
    come together in different ways, across species and even among different people.
    There are as many different ways of being conscious as there are different conscious
    organisms. Eventually, the hard problem itself may succumb, so that we will be
    able to understand consciousness as being continuous with the rest of nature without
    having to adopt any arbitrary ‘ism’ stating by fiat how phenomenology and physics
    are related. This is the promise of the real problem.

- text: At any one time we have precisely one conscious experience out of vastly many
    possible conscious experiences. Every conscious experience therefore delivers
    a massive reduction of uncertainty, since this experience is being had, and not
    that experience, or that experience, and so on. And reduction of uncertainty is
    – mathematically – what is meant by information.

- text: This underpins the main claim of the theory, which is that a system is conscious
    to the extent that its whole generates more information than its parts.
  page: Page 82
- text: It’s important to recognise that these challenges – including that of measuring
    intrinsic information, rather than observer-relative, extrinsic information –
    are only problems for us as scientists, as external observers, trying to calculate
    Φ. According to IIT, any particular system would just have a Φ. It would go about
    its business integrating information in just the same way that when you throw
    a stone, it traces an arc through the sky without needing to calculate its trajectory
    according to the laws of gravity. Just because 68a theory is difficult to test
    doesn’t mean it’s wrong. It just means it’s difficult to test.

- text: More than a thousand years later, but still a thousand years ago, the Arab
    scholar Ibn al Haytham wrote that perception, in the here and now, depends on
    processes of ‘judgement and inference’ rather than providing direct access to
    an objective reality.

- text: The third and most important ingredient in the controlled hallucination view
    is the claim that perceptual experience – in this case the subjective experience
    of ‘seeing a coffee cup’ – is determined by the content of the (top-down) predictions,
    and not by the (bottom-up) sensory signals. We never experience sensory signals
    themselves, we only ever experience interpretations of them. Mix these ingredients
    together and we’ve cooked up a Copernican inversion for how to think about perception.
    It seems as though the world is revealed directly to our conscious minds through
    our sensory organs. With this mindset, it is natural to think of perception as
    a process of bottom-up feature detection – a ‘reading’ of the world around us.
    But what we actually perceive is a top-down, inside-out neuronal fantasy that
    is reined in by reality, not a transparent window onto whatever that reality may
    be.

- text: When I look at a red chair, the redness I experience depends both on properties
    of the chair and on properties of my brain. It corresponds to the content of a
    set of perceptual predictions about the ways in which a specific kind of surface
    reflects light. There is no redness-as-such in the world or in the brain. As Paul
    Cézanne said, ‘colour is the place where our brain and the universe meet.’

- text: In statistics, the essence of prediction is in catering for the absence of
    sufficient data. Whether this is because predictions are about the future – one
    can think of the future as ‘insufficient data’ – or about some current but incompletely
    unknown state of affairs, doesn’t matter.

- text: Thinking about action in this way underlines how action and perception are
    two sides of the same coin. Rather than perception being the input and action
    being the output with respect to some central ‘mind’, action and perception are
    both forms of brain-based prediction.
  page: Page 142
- text: Our perceptual world alive with colours, shapes, and sounds is nothing more
    and nothing less than our brain’s best guess of the hidden causes of its colourless,
    shapeless, and soundless sensory inputs.
  page: Page 142
- text: 'The concept of the beholder’s share cries out to be connected with predictive
    theories of perception – like the controlled hallucination theory. As Kandel put
    it: ‘The insight that the beholder’s perception involves a top-down inference
    convinced Gombrich that there is no “innocent eye”: that is, all visual perception
    is based on classifying concepts and interpreting visual information. One cannot
    perceive that which one cannot classify.’'

- text: I wanted a cup of tea, but I did not choose to want a cup of tea. Voluntary
    actions are voluntary not because they descend from an immaterial soul, nor because
    they ascend from a quantum soup. They are voluntary because they express what
    I, as a person, want to do, even though I cannot choose these wants.
  page: Page 272
- text: The second defining feature is the feeling that I could have done otherwise.
    When I experience an action as voluntary, the character of the experience is not
    only that I did X, but that I did X and not Y, even though I could have done Y.
  page: Page 272
- text: This is the essence of the real problem approach to consciousness. Accept
    that consciousness exists, and then ask how the various phenomenological properties
    of consciousness – which is to say how conscious experiences are structured, what
    form they take – relate to properties of brains, brains that are embodied in
    bodies and embedded in worlds

- text: There is no standard of greater or lesser satisfaction other than individual
    judgments of value, different for various people and for the same people at various
    times. What makes a man feel uneasy and less uneasy is established by him from
    the standard of his own will and judgment, from his personal and subjective valuation.
    Nobody is in a position to decree what should make a fellow man happier.

    not exposed to any change. Change could only impair its perfection and transform
    it into a less perfect state; the mere possibility that a change can occur is
    incompatible with the concept of absolute perfection. But the absence of change—i.e.,
    perfect immutability, rigidity and immobility—is tantamount to the absence of
    life. Life and perfection are incompatible, but so are death and perfection.

- text: Acting man chooses between various opportunities offered for choice. He prefers
    one alternative to others. It is customary to say that acting man has a scale
    of wants or values in his mind when he arranges his actions. On the basis of such
    a scale he satisfies what is of higher value, i.e., his more urgent wants, and
    leaves unsatisfied what is of lower value, i.e., what is a less urgent want. There
    is no objection to such a presentation of the state of affairs. However, one must
    not forget that the scale of values or wants manifests itself only in the reality
    of action. These scales have no independent existence apart from the actual behavior
    of individuals. The only source from which our knowledge concerning these scales
    is derived is the observation of a man's actions. Every action is always in perfect
    agreement with the scale of values or wants because these scales are nothing but
    an instrument for the interpretation of a man's acting.

    grades. It is expressive of an order of preference and sequence, but not expressive
    of measure and weight. Only the ordinal numbers can be applied to it, but not
    the cardinal numbers.

    We do not know everything which would be required for a definite decision between

    of the creators. If Dante and Beethoven had not existed, one would not have been
    in a position to produce the Divina Commedia or the Ninth Symphony by assigning
    other men to these tasks. Neither society nor single individuals can substantially
    further the genius and his work. The highest intensity of the “demand” and the
    most peremptory order of the government are ineffectual. The genius does not deliver
    to order.

- text: Only the human mind that directs action and production is creative. The mind
    too appertains to the universe and to nature; it is a part of the given and existing
    world. To call the mind creative is not to indulge in any metaphysical speculations.
    We call it creative because we are at a loss to trace the changes brought about
    by human action farther back than to the point at which we are faced with the
    intervention of reason directing human activities. Production is not something
    physical, natural, and external; it is a spiritual and intellectual phenomenon.
    Its essential requisites are not human labor and external natural forces and things,
    but the decision of the mind to use these factors as means for the attainment
    of ends. What produces the product is not toil and trouble in themselves, but
    the fact that the toilers are guided by reason. The human mind alone has the power
    to remove uneasiness.

- text: The questions whether society or the individual is to be considered as the
    ultimate end, and whether the interests of society should be subordinated to those
    of the individuals or the interests of the individuals to those of society are
    fruitless. Action is always action of individual men. The social or societal element
    is a certain orientation of the actions of individual men. The category end makes
    sense only when applied to action.
  page: Page 243
- text: A Critique of the Holistic and Metaphysical View of Society According to the
    doctrines of universalism, conceptual realism, holism, collectivism, and some
    representatives of Gestaltpsychologie, society is an entity living its own life,
    independent of and separate from the lives of the various individuals, acting
    on its own behalf and aiming at its own ends which are different from the ends
    sought by the individuals. Then, of course, an antagonism between the aims of
    society and those of its members can emerge. In order to safeguard the flowering
    and further development of society it becomes necessary to master the selfishness
    of the individuals and to compel them to sacrifice their egoistic designs to the
    benefit of society. At this point all these holistic doctrines are bound to abandon
    the secular methods of human science and logical reasoning and to shift to theological
    or metaphysical professions of faith. They must assume that Providence, through
    its prophets, apostles, and charismatic leaders, forces men who are constitutionally
    wicked, i.e., prone to pursue their own ends, to walk in the ways of righteousness
    which the Lord or Weltgeist or history wants them to walk.

- text: The principle of majority rule or government by the people as recommended
    by liberalism does not aim at the supremacy of the average or common man. It certainly
    does not mean, as some critics assert, the advocacy of the rule of the mean, of
    the lowbred, of the domestic barbarians. The liberals too believe that a nation
    should be ruled by those best fitted for this task. But they believe that a man's
    ability to rule proves itself better by convincing his fellow-citizens than by
    using force upon them. There is, of course, no guarantee that the voters will
    entrust office to the most competent candidate. But no other system could offer
    such a guarantee. If the majority of the nation is committed to unsound principles
    and prefers unworthy office-seekers, there is no remedy other than to try to change
    their mind by expounding more reasonable principles and recommending better men.
    A minority will never win lasting success by other means.

    commonly called individualism is a philosophy of social cooperation and the progressive
    intensification of the social nexus.

    do not contend that the mere fact that a policy is advocated by the many is a

    and to all other religions which evolved from Jewish monotheism. What characterizes

    by reasoning.

- text: 'Experience teaches man that cooperative action is more efficient and productive
    than isolated action of self-sufficient individuals. The natural conditions determining
    man''s life and effort are such that the division of labor increases output per
    unit of labor expended. These natural facts are: First: the innate inequality
    of men with regard to their ability to perform various kinds of labor. Second:
    the unequal distribution of the nature-given, nonhuman opportunities of production
    on the surface of the earth.'
  page: Page 261
- text: There is still a third fact, viz., that there are undertakings whose accomplishment
    exceeds the forces of a single man and requires the joint effort of several. Some
    of them require an expenditure of labor which no single man can perform because
    his capacity to work is not great enough. Others again could be accomplished by
    individuals; but the time which they would have to devote to the work would be
    so long that the result would only be attained late and would not compensate for
    the labor expended. In both cases only joint effort makes it possible to attain
    the end sought.
  page: Page 262
- text: If and as far as labor under the division of labor is more productive than
    isolated labor, and if and as far as man is able to realize this fact, human action
    itself tends toward cooperation and association; man becomes a social being not
    in sacrificing his own concerns for the sake of a mythical Moloch, society, but
    in aiming at an improvement in his own welfare.

- text: Mechanization is the fruit of the division of labor, its most beneficial achievement,
    not its motive and fountain spring. Power-driven specialized machinery could be
    employed only in a social environment under the division of labor. Every step
    forward on the road toward the use of more specialized, more refined, and more
    productive machines requires a further specialization of tasks.

    human and best serves your well-being. One must tell them: If you satisfy your

    to live in fine homes, to clothe yourselves, and a thousand other things which
    only society can provide. You cannot have everything, you must choose.'

    and to act. The final decisions rest with acting men, not with the theorists.
    Science's contribution to life and action does not consist in establishing value
    judgments, but in clarification of the conditions under which man must act and
    in elucidation of the effects of various modes of action. It puts at the disposal
    of acting man all the information he needs in order to make his choices in full
    awareness of their consequences. It

    it eats or drinks. The evolution of human reasoning from the naïve thinking of
    primitive man to the more subtle thinking of modern science took place within
    society. However, thinking itself is always an achievement of individuals. There
    is joint action, but no joint thinking. There is only tradition which preserves
    thoughts and communicates them to others as a stimulus to their thinking. However,
    man has no means of appropriating the thoughts of his precursors other than to
    think them over again.

    which a human mind cannot proceed farther. They must never acquiesce in any solutions
    conveyed by older generations, they must always question anew every theory and
    every theorem, they must never relax in their endeavors to brush away fallacies
    and to find the best possible cognition. They must fight error by unmasking spurious
    doctrines and by expounding truth.

    the ward prefers the former and thus integrates himself into the hegemonic bond.
    Every new command places this choice before him again. In yielding again and again
    he himself contributes his share to the continuous existence of the hegemonic
    societal body. Even as a ward in such a system he is an acting human being, i.e.,
    a being not simply yielding to blind impulses, but using his reason in choosing
    between alternatives.

- text: Complacency, self-righteousness, and hypocrisy exult in scorning the “dollar-philosophy”
    of our age. Neurotic reformers, mentally unbalanced literati, and ambitious demagogues
    take pleasure in indicting “rationality” and in preaching the gospel of the “irrational.”
    In the eyes of these babblers money and calculation are the source of the most
    serious evils. However, the fact that men have developed a method of ascertaining
    as far as possible the expediency of their actions and of removing uneasiness
    in the most practical and economic way does not prevent anybody from arranging
    his conduct according to the principle he considers to be right. The “materialism”
    of the stock exchange and of business accountancy does not hinder anybody from
    living up to the standards of Thomas à Kempis or from dying for a noble cause.
    The fact that the masses prefer detective stories to poetry and that it therefore
    pays better to write the former than the latter, is not caused by the use of money
    and monetary accounting. It is not the fault of money that there are gangsters,
    thieves, murderers, prostitutes, corruptible officials and judges.

    to be roused from their daydreams by the voice of critical reason. Reality sickens

    pennies.

    with the problems man has to face on account of the fact that his life is conditioned
    by natural factors. It deals with action, i.e., with the conscious endeavors to
    remove as far as possible felt uneasiness.

    for the measurement of the degree of their objective satisfaction. In expressing
    such opinions and in recommending the use of such criteria to guide the government's
    policy, one proposes to deal with men as the breeder deals with his cattle. But
    the reformers fail to realize that there is no universal principle of alimentation
    valid for all men. Which one of the various principles one chooses depends entirely
    on the aims one wants to attain. The cattle breeder does not feed his cows in
    order to make them happy, but in order to attain the ends which he has assigned
    to them in his own plans.

- text: The value judgments of an individual differentiate between what makes him
    more satisfied and what less. The value judgments a man pronounces about another
    man's satisfaction do not assert anything about this other man's satisfaction.
    They only assert what condition of this other man better satisfies the man who
    pronounces the judgment. The reformers searching for the maximum of general satisfaction
    have told us merely what state of other people's affairs would best suit themselves.

    economy. The various complementary factors of production cannot come together
    spontaneously. They need to be combined by the purposive efforts of men aiming
    at certain ends and motivated by the urge to improve their state of satisfaction.
    In eliminating the entrepreneur one eliminates the driving force of the whole
    market system.

    are not tangible, thy cannot be perceived by the senses. Many people lack the
    discernment to take cognizance of them. They fall victim to the delusion that
    entrepreneurs and capitalists are irresponsible autocrats whom nobody calls to

    applying to business the terminology of political rule and military action. Successful

    complex flavors and nutrients quickly. There are many other ways to preserve vegetables,
    like nuka (Japanese technique) and with miso. Fermented foods are nutritious,
    unlike canned foods. As Alex Lewin, author of Real Food Fermentation and Kombucha,
    Kefir, and Beyond said: “With canning you kill all of the microbes and seal it
    hermetically. With fermentation you invite the microbes you want and don’t let
    in the ones you don’t. Fermentation is diplomacy and canning is a massacre.”'

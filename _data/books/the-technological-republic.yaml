- text: When emerging technologies that give rise to wealth do not advance the broader
    public interest, trouble often follows. Put differently, the decadence of a culture
    or civilization, and indeed its ruling class, will be forgiven only if that culture
    is capable of delivering economic growth and security for the public. In this
    way, the willingness of the engineering and scientific communities to come to
    the aid of the nation has been vital not only to the legitimacy of the private
    sector but to the durability of political institutions across the West.

- text: A generation of founders cloaked themselves in the rhetoric of lofty and ambitious
    purpose—indeed their rallying cry to change the world has grown lifeless from
    overuse—but often raised enormous amounts of capital and hired legions of talented
    engineers merely to build photo-sharing apps and chat interfaces for the modern
    consumer. A skepticism of government work and national ambition took hold in the
    Valley. The grand, collectivist experiments of the earlier part of the twentieth
    century were discarded in favor of a narrow attentiveness to the desires and needs
    of the individual. The market rewarded shallow engagement with the potential of
    technology, as startup after startup catered to the whims of late capitalist culture
    without any interest in constructing the technical infrastructure that would address
    our most significant challenges as a nation. The age of social media platforms
    and food delivery apps had arrived. Medical breakthroughs, education reform, and
    military advances would have to wait.

- text: Our entire defense establishment and military procurement complex were built
    to supply soldiers for a type of war—on grand battlefields and with clashes of
    masses of humans—that may never again be fought. This next era of conflict will
    be won or lost with software. One age of deterrence, the atomic age, is ending,
    and a new era of deterrence built on AI is set to begin. The risk, however, is
    that we think we have already won.

- text: The ability to develop the tools required to deploy force against an opponent,
    combined with a credible threat to use such force, is often the foundation of
    any effective negotiation with an adversary. The underlying cause of our cultural
    hesitation to openly pursue technical superiority may be our collective sense
    that we have already won. But the certainty with which many believed that history
    had come to an end, and that Western liberal democracy had emerged in permanent
    victory after the struggles of the twentieth century, is as dangerous as it is
    pervasive.

- text: “To be coercive, violence has to be anticipated,” he wrote in the 1960s as
    the United States grappled with its military escalation in Vietnam. “The power
    to hurt is bargaining power. To exploit it is diplomacy—vicious diplomacy, but
    diplomacy.” The virtue of Schelling’s version of realism was its unsentimental
    disentanglement of the moral from the strategic. As he made clear, “War is always
    a bargaining process.” Before one engages with the justice or injustice of a policy,
    it is necessary to understand one’s leverage or lack thereof in a negotiation,
    armed or otherwise. The contemporary approach to international affairs too often
    assumes, either explicitly or implicitly, that the correctness of one’s views
    from a moral or ethical perspective precludes the need to engage with the more
    distasteful and fundamental question of relative power with respect to a geopolitical
    opponent, and specifically which party has a superior ability to inflict harm
    on the other.

    so foundational that it merits no explanation. These engineers inhabit a world
    without trade-offs, ideological or economic.

    of war.

- text: And for nations that hold themselves to a far higher moral standard than their
    adversaries when it comes to the use of force, even technical parity with an enemy
    is insufficient. A weapons system in the hands of an ethical society, and one
    rightly wary of its use, will act as an effective deterrent only if it is far
    more powerful than the capability of an adversary who would not hesitate to kill
    the innocent.

    powerless.

    relieves us of the need to navigate among the difficult and imperfect trade-offs
    that the world presents.

    “Why do you have to tell people how little we have and how much we owe?” Her husband
    replied that politicians were destined to “live in a goldfish bowl.” But the systematic
    elimination of private spaces, even for our public figures, has consequences,
    and ultimately further incentivizes only those given to theatrics, and who crave
    a stage, to run for office.

    purpose of genuine education—remain our best defense against the mind becoming
    a product or vehicle for the ambitions of another.

- text: In Baltzell’s view, an aristocracy driven by talent is an essential feature
    of any republic. The challenge is ensuring that such aristocracies remain open
    to new members and do not descend into mere caste structures, which close their
    ranks along racial or religious lines.

- text: 'The antiseptic nature of modern discourse, dominated by an unwavering commitment
    to justice but deeply wary when it comes to substantive positions on the good
    life, is a product of our own reluctance, and indeed fear, to offend, to alienate,
    and to risk the disapproval of the crowd. Yet there is too much that lies “beyond
    justice,” in the words of Ágnes Heller, the Hungarian philosopher born in Budapest
    in 1929. As Heller writes, “Justice is the skeleton: the good life is the flesh
    and blood.”'

- text: The substantive triumph of Orientalism was its exposing to a broad audience
    the extent to which the telling of history, the act of summation and synthesis
    into narrative from disparate strands of detail and fact, was not itself a neutral,
    disinterested act, but rather an exercise of power in the world

- text: 'Hawke’s character, Jesse, offers the familiar challenge to the traps of consumption
    and to materialist desire. “I just feel like I’m designed to be slightly dissatisfied
    with everything,” he says, wistfully. “I satisfy one desire, and it just agitates
    another.” Celine, played by Delpy, responds, winning the exchange: “But I feel
    really alive when I want something…. Wanting, whether it’s intimacy with another
    person or a new pair of shoes, is kind of beautiful. I like that we have those
    ever-renewing desires.”'

- text: The bees that Lindauer and others since have studied do not incorporate caste-based
    social hierarchies in order to address the enormous collective action challenges
    that they face, but rather distribute autonomy to as great a degree as possible
    to the fringes—the scouts—of their organization. The individuals at the periphery
    of a group, who often have the latest and most valuable information regarding
    the suitability of potential nesting sites, and can take into account shifting
    conditions, are the ones who cast their ballots by dancing for the group. The
    swarm organizes itself around the problem at hand.

- text: The modern enterprise is often too quick to avoid such friction. We have today
    privileged a kind of ease in corporate life, a culture of agreeableness that can
    move institutions away, not toward, creative output. The impulse—indeed rush—to
    smooth over any hint of conflict within businesses and government agencies is
    misguided, leaving many with the misimpression that a life of ease awaits and
    rewarding those whose principal desire is the approval of others. As the comedian
    John Mulaney has said, “Likability is a jail.”

    of the mechanical world, the digital, or even perhaps the written—descend from
    his or her tower of theory into the morass of actual details as they exist, not
    as they have been theorized to be.

    in 1922, “get down from noble aloofness into the muddy stream of concrete things.”

    of the twentieth century, put it, “I try to paint what is actually there.” The
    act of observation, of looking closely while suspending judgment—taking the facts
    in and resisting the urge to impose one’s view on them—sits at the heart of any
    engineering culture, including ours.

- text: And the reconstruction of a technological republic will, among other things,
    require the rebuilding of an ownership society, a founder culture that came from
    tech but has the potential to reshape government, where nobody is entrusted with
    leadership who does not have a stake in their own success.

    mask” in favor of the white marble of the Apollo. But should we be left with no
    means of discerning between art that moves us forward, ideas that advance humanity’s
    cause, and those that do not? The risk is that our fear to pronounce, to speak,
    to prefer, has left us without direction and confidence when it comes to marshaling
    our shared resources and talents. Fear has led us to recoil and shrink our sense

    Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, a talented graduate could perhaps join Goldman
    Sachs, which was a pioneer of partnership compensation models, or perhaps a white-shoe
    law firm, where attorneys shared the profits, and risk, of their work. But those
    experiments have essentially withered; such firms still attract talented and ambitious
    minds, but they are paid salaries, often high ones, but salaries nonetheless.
    The upside of the endeavors and creative energy of labor is captured by the capitalists.

- text: The entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley do not lack idealism; indeed, they often
    appear to be brimming with it. But it is thin and can wither under even the slightest
    scrutiny. The legions of young founders have for decades now routinely claimed
    that they aspire to change the world. Yet such claims have grown meaningless from
    overuse. This cloak of idealism was put on in order to relieve these young founders
    of the need to develop anything approaching a more substantial worldview. And
    the nation-state itself, the most effective means of collective organization in
    pursuit of a shared purpose that the world has ever known, was cast aside as an
    obstacle to progress.

    of a search for truth and convinced himself that such a distinction was possible.
    But it was this “indifference to any goal, or of aimlessness and drifting,” as
    Strauss put it, that is the seed of our current nihilism as a culture.

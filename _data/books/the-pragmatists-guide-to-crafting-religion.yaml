- text: Ironically, the risk to us from making these kinds of generalizations does
    not come from the cultures we are generalizing, as most are hard cultures, and
    very few hard cultures care about generalizations. Hard cultures are typically
    quite aware that they produce differential outcomes and are distinct from the
    rest of society—that’s kind of the point. Rather, the risk comes from pop culture
    variants that use the effective suppression of intellectual inquiry as a metric
    for status signaling

    the promise of removing emotional pain21.

    a paperclip maximizer of “no emotional pain” programmed into our social infrastructure
    and it is gaining steam.

    the time and effort required to literally build a society that structurally embodies
    their values.

    change and impermanence with abandon are far less likely to survive and produce
    viable offspring.

    have more than three kids, there is more of your biological identity (1.5X) in
    them than in you.

- text: Better still, because most have the freedom to choose reproductive partners
    they admire, having kids yields an opportunity to augment individual biological
    identities by mixing them with those of people we respect and admire—people whose
    unique DNA will improve our own.

    core value of identity in the first place.

    divergence, and conflict between and among individuals, species, and groups. This
    is not a flaw of the cycle or something to escape; it is the cycle.

    a state we cannot yet conceive where individuals will experience genuinely meaningful
    existence.

    Smith (descended from the smith caste) had higher physical capabilities and an
    above-average aptitude for strength-related activities, while those with the surname
    Tailor (descended from the tailor caste) had a higher-than-average aptitude for
    dexterity-related tasks.8 The treatment of Black populations

- text: Conservatism as a political movement sees the individual as an avatar of their
    cultivar and optimizes for intergenerational fitness and cultural agency. In contrast,
    progressivism as a movement atomizes the individual and focuses on intragenerational
    quality of life and individual agency. That said, “conservatism” is not really
    one cohesive group as we often think of it but rather the manifestation of a number
    of hard cultural strategies optimized to protect intergenerational fitness.

- text: The difference between conservative hard cultures and actual communists is
    the extent to which they trust state institutions to run things better than they
    do—or at least to not be a threat to them. The more an individual trusts their
    own community to be fair and well run, the less they will trust a government to
    interfere and the more “conservative” they will appear.

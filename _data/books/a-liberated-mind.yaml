- text: "This was the best book I read in 2022. It had a lasting impact on my day-to-day life. Fears are telling me what I value. I am not my thoughts. Some thought patterns, doubts, anxieties are just part of who I am and my journey - I can struggle or accept that they are with me on the ride. Life is not a problem to be solved. Thinking is not always the right tool for the job."

- text: Historically, as we shall see, innovations have tended to come from networks
    more than from hierarchies. The problem is that networks are not easily directed
    ‘towards a common objective … that requires concentration of resources in space
    and time within large organizations, like armies, bureaucracies, large factories,
    vertically organized corporations’.6 Networks may be spontaneously creative but
    they are not strategic.

    Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach are hunting for stolen Confederate gold. The treasure,
    they discover, is buried under a headstone in a huge Civil War cemetery. Unfortunately,
    they have no idea which headstone. Having earlier taken the precaution of emptying
    Wallach’s revolver, Eastwood turns to him and utters the immortal lines: ‘You
    see, in this world there’s two kinds of people, my friend. Those with loaded guns.
    And those who dig. You dig.’ This is a modern example of an ancient truth. For
    most of history, life has been hierarchical. A few have enjoyed the privileges
    that come from monopolizing violence. Everyone else has dug.'

    names of townships, cities, and counties, a vast number of others are formed and
    maintained by the agency of private individuals. The citizen of the United States
    is taught from infancy to rely upon his own exertions in order to resist the evils
    and the difficulties of life; he looks upon the social authority with an eye of
    mistrust and anxiety, and he claims its assistance only when he is unable to do
    without it … In the United States associations are established to promote the
    public safety, commerce, industry, morality, and religion. There is no end which
    the human will despairs of attaining through the combined power of individuals
    united into a society.

    of legitimate rule, appropriating Egyptian, Roman and Habsburg regalia and iconography,
    Napoleon could never achieve the one thing upon which hierarchical systems of
    rule ultimately depend (and insist upon): legitimacy.'

- text: A key reason for the British Empire’s scale and durability, then, was the
    relatively light touch of the central authority. Though its theory was hierarchical
    – indeed, like John Buchan, Victorian racial theorists ranked mankind according
    to inherited levels of intelligence – its practice was to delegate considerable
    power to local rulers and private networks. Unlike Napoleon’s short-lived European
    empire, the British Empire was not run by a micro-managing genius, but by a club
    of gentlemanly amateurs, whose seemingly effortless superiority depended on the
    unsung strivings of local agents and native collaborators.

- text: In most history, success is over-represented, for the victors out-write the
    losers. In the history of networks, the opposite often applies. Successful networks
    evade public attention; unsuccessful ones attract it, and it is their notoriety,
    rather than their achievement, that leads to their over-representation.

- text: Not until the 1970s did it begin to become apparent that, in peacetime, even
    the best-laid plans were liable to descend into a quagmire of stagflation and
    corruption. High-modernist planning wreaked all kinds of havoc in its heyday,
    from the collectivization of Soviet agriculture to the building of Brasilia and
    the compulsory ujamaa villages in Tanzania. Yet it could always survive such catastrophes,
    if only because their effect was to kill off any kind of opposition. It was in
    its decrepitude that the planned system could be challenged.

    well-suited to the activity of total war – an activity characterized by monopsony,
    as the state is the sole buyer, and standardization, as destruction is much simpler
    than production – was wholly unsuited to a consumer society. Those who had fought
    in the world wars had been promised prosperity as well as victory. In practice,
    that could be achieved only if millions of households were freed to make billions
    of choices, to which hundreds of thousands of firms could respond.

    because it has become so complex is therefore paradoxical, and the result of a
    complete misunderstanding … The fact is, rather, that we can preserve an order
    of such complexity … only indirectly by enforcing and improving the rules conductive
    to the formation of a spontaneous order.’

    of business networks at both the national and international level represented
    something more than simply the triumph of markets over the hierarchical corporation.
    ‘In markets,’ he argued, ‘the standard strategy is to drive the hardest possible
    bargain on the immediate exchange. In networks, the preferred option is often
    creating indebtedness and reliance over the long haul’:'

    World, you weary giants of flesh and steel’: I come from Cyberspace, the new home
    of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You
    are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no
    elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater
    authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global
    social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you
    seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any
    methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear … Cyberspace does not lie within
    your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction
    project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective
    actions … Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself,
    arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications … We are creating
    a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic
    power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone,
    anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear
    of being coerced into silence or conformity. Your legal concepts of property,
    expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us … [Your] increasingly
    hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous
    lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of

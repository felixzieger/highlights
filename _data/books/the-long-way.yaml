    them all overboard, to avoid the temptation of closing with the coast to give
    word via a ship or a fisherman in the dangerous Bass Strait between Australia
    and Tasmania.

    during my sailing school cruises in the Mediterranean. Instead of bearing 110°
    from France to Corsica my crew had to steer with the mistral swell very slightly
    off the port quarter. At night, it was the Pole Star one small hand abaft the
    port beam. And if there was neither distinct swell nor star, we made do with whatever
    we had. I wanted it that way, because concentrating on a magnetized needle prevents
    one from participating in the real universe, seen and unseen, where a sailboat
    moves.

    can only give them my first log, with birds, sea, daily sights and little everyday
    problems. My real log is written in the sea and sky; it can’t be photographed
    and given to others. It has gradually come to life out of all that has surrounded
    us for months: the sounds of water on the hull, the sounds of wind gliding on
    the sails, the silences full of secret things between my boat and me, like the
    times I spent as a child listening to the forest talk.'

    the harness in the pocket, because I keep hold of the cabin hatch cover then,
    eyes and ears everywhere at once for erratic breaking seas, ready to open the
    hatch and jump inside to safety. A second and a half is all I need to open the
    cover, step through the hatch, quickly flop down on the inside steering seat and
    slam the hatch over my head, pulling down hard so that the neoprene seal fits
    tight all around. With the harness I would feel less mobile. And there is something
    else . . . the intimate participation with things around me. The harness would
    only link me to some steel cleat, not to the rest.

    believe it helped me to see things that I may not have seen as clearly on my own,
    during the voyage.

    go beyond the staysail: it marks the farthest limit of good sense. In surfing,
    water is no longer water, but rock.'

    I just didn’t feel like it. Penguins and seals go for long periods without food
    in the mating season, other animals do the same in the great migrations. And deep
    within himself man may carry the same instinct to leave food aside, as animals
    do in the solemn moments of their lives.

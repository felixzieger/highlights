- text: I didn’t become an always-rational, emotion-free decision-maker from thinking
    in bets. I still made (and make) plenty of mistakes. Mistakes, emotions, losing—those
    things are all inevitable because we are human. The approach of thinking in bets
    moved me toward objectivity, accuracy, and open-mindedness. That movement compounds
    over time to create significant changes in our lives.

    described game theory during a London taxi ride. Bronowski was a chess enthusiast
    and asked him to clarify. “You mean, the theory of games like chess?” Bronowski
    quoted von Neumann’s response: “‘No, no,’ he said. ‘Chess is not a game. Chess
    is a well-defined form of computation. You may not be able to work out the answers,
    but in theory there must be a solution, a right procedure in any position. Now,
    real games,’ he said, ‘are not like that at all. Real life is not like that. Real
    life consists of bluffing, of little tactics of deception, of asking yourself
    what is the other man going to think I mean to do. And that is what games are
    about in my theory.’”'

- text: The definition of “bet” is much broader. Merriam-Webster’s Online Dictionary
    defines “bet” as “a choice made by thinking about what will probably happen,”
    “to risk losing (something) when you try to do or achieve something” and “to make
    decisions that are based on the belief that something will happen or is true.”

- text: How can we be sure that we are choosing the alternative that is best for us?
    What if another alternative would bring us more happiness, satisfaction, or money?
    The answer, of course, is we can’t be sure. Things outside our control (luck)
    can influence the result. The futures we imagine are merely possible. They haven’t
    happened yet. We can only make our best guess, given what we know and don’t know,
    at what the future will look like. If we’ve never lived in Des Moines, how can
    we possibly be sure how we will like it? When we decide, we are betting whatever
    we value (happiness, success, satisfaction, money, time, reputation, etc.) on
    one of a set of possible and uncertain futures. That is where the risk is. Poker
    players live in a world where that risk is made explicit. They can get comfortable
    with uncertainty because they put it up front in their decisions. Ignoring the
    risk and uncertainty in every decision might make us feel better in the short
    run, but the cost to the quality of our decision-making can be immense. If we
    can find ways to become more comfortable with uncertainty, we can see the world
    more accurately and be better for it.

    are to fake news or disinformation. After all, smart people are more likely to
    analyze and effectively evaluate where information is coming from, right? Part
    of being “smart” is being good at processing information, parsing the quality
    of an argument and the credibility of the source. So, intuitively, it feels like
    smart people should have the ability to spot motivated reasoning coming and should
    have more intellectual resources to fight it. Surprisingly, being smart can actually
    make bias worse. Let me give you a different intuitive frame: the smarter you
    are, the better you are at constructing a narrative that supports your beliefs,
    rationalizing and framing the data to fit your argument or point of view. After
    all, people in the “spin room” in a political'

- text: It’s a shame the social contract for poker players is so different than for
    the rest of us in this regard because a lot of good can result from someone saying,
    “Wanna bet?” Offering a wager brings the risk out in the open, making explicit
    what is already implicit (and frequently overlooked). The more we recognize that
    we are betting on our beliefs (with our happiness, attention, health, money, time,
    or some other limited resource), the more we are likely to temper our statements,
    getting closer to the truth as we acknowledge the risk inherent in what we believe.
  page: Page 72
- text: Once we start doing that, we are more likely to recognize that there is always
    a degree of uncertainty, that we are generally less sure than we thought we were,
    that practically nothing is black and white, 0% or 100%. And that’s a pretty good
    philosophy for living.

    problem: the way things turn out could be the result of our decisions, luck, or
    some combination of the two. Just as we are almost never 100% wrong or right,
    outcomes are almost never 100% due to luck or skill. Learning from experience
    doesn’t offer us the orderliness of chess or, for that matter, folding and sorting
    laundry'

    of how things turn out for anyone else. Yet, on a fundamental level, fielding
    someone’s bad outcome as their fault feels good to us. On a fundamental level,
    fielding someone’s good outcome as luck helps our narrative along.

    is a bet, we consider a greater number of alternative causes more seriously than
    we otherwise would have. That is truthseeking.

- text: When we treat outcome fielding as a bet, it pushes us to field outcomes more
    objectively into the appropriate buckets because that is how bets are won. Winning
    feels good. Winning is a positive update to our personal narrative. Winning is
    a reward. With enough practice, reinforced by the reward of feeling good about
    ourselves, thinking of fielding outcomes as bets will become a habit of mind.

- text: Once we start actively training ourselves in testing alternative hypotheses
    and perspective taking, it becomes clear that outcomes are rarely 100% luck or
    100% skill. This means that when new information comes in, we have options beyond
    unquestioned confirmation or reversal. We can modify our beliefs along a spectrum
    because we know it is a spectrum, not a choice between opposites without middle
    ground.

    an experimental result would replicate, were right 58% of the time. A betting
    market in which the traders were the exact same experts and those experts had
    money on the line predicted correctly 71% of the time. A lot of people were surprised
    to learn that the expert opinion expressed as a bet was more accurate than expert
    opinion expressed through peer review, since peer review is considered a rock-solid
    foundation of the scientific method.

    we need to be particularly skeptical of information that agrees with us because

    do the actions of this hand affect how they and their opponents make decisions
    on future hands? Poker players really live in this probabilistic world of, “What
    are the possible futures? What are the probabilities of those possible futures?”
    And they get very comfortable with the fact that they don’t know exactly because
    they can’t see their opponent’s cards. This is true of most strategic thinking.
    Whether it involves sales strategies, business strategies, or courtroom strategies,
    the best strategists are considering a fuller range of possible scenarios, anticipating
    and considering the strategic responses to each, and so on deep into the decision
    tree.'

    “who had strong positive fantasies about slimming down . . . lost twenty-four
    pounds less than those who pictured themselves more negatively. Dreaming about
    achieving a goal apparently didn’t help that goal come to fruition. It impeded
    it from happening. The starry-eyed dreamers in the study were less energized to
    behave in ways that helped them lose weight.”

    on the negative space. Over the long run, however, seeing the world more objectively
    and making better decisions will feel better than turning a blind eye to negative
    scenarios. In a way, backcasting without premortems is a form of temporal discounting:
    if we imagine a positive future, we feel better now, but we’ll more than compensate
    for giving up that immediate gratification through the benefits of seeing the
    world more accurately, making better initial decisions, and being nimbler about
    what the world throws our way.'

- text: One of the things poker teaches is that we have to take satisfaction in assessing
    the probabilities of different outcomes given the decisions under consideration
    and in executing the bet we think is best. With the constant stream of decisions
    and outcomes under uncertain conditions, you get used to losing a lot.

    even after making the best possible bets. We are going to do better, and be happier,
    if we start by recognizing that we’ll never be sure of the future. That changes
    our task from trying to be right every time, an impossible job, to navigating
    our way through the uncertainty by calibrating our beliefs to move toward, little
    by little, a more accurate and objective representation of the world.

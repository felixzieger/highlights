    that someone might risk missing her cooking. She’d poured blood and sweat and
    tears into building our little community, but the secret ingredient had turned
    out to be soup. She was a really good cook, and what her magazine and occasional
    impassioned speeches couldn’t do, an invitation to one of her dinner parties might.
    It was weird, the way little things like that turned the wheels of destiny. I’ve
    always wondered if history is missing some story like how the Founding Fathers

    lose the ability to convince Reality of anything. The American Board of Ritual
    Magic, originally a perfectly ordinary example of regulatory capture, had taken

    an intentional action. Let’s go further – buying represents a sacrifice. Buying
    is when you sacrifice something dear to you to get something you want even more.
    Evil isn’t something God couldn’t figure out how to avoid, it’s something He covets.
    What did God sacrifice for the sake of evil? Two silver coins. We immediately
    notice the number “two”. Two is not typically associated with God. God is One.
    Two is right out. The kabbalists identify the worst demon, the nadir of all demons,
    as Thamiel, whose name means “duality in God”. Two is dissonance, divorce, division,
    dilemmas, distance, discrimination, diabolism. This, then, was God’s sacrifice.
    In order to create evil, He took up duality. “Why would God want to create evil?
    God is pure Good!” Exactly. The creation of anything at all other than God requires
    evil. God is perfect. Everything else is imperfect. Imperfection contains evil
    by definition. Two scoops of evil is the first ingredient in the recipe for creating
    universes. Finitude is evil. Form is evil. Without evil all you have is God, who,
    as the kabbalists tell us, is pure Nothing. If you want something, evil is part
    of the deal.

    YOU SHOULD PROBABLY JUST BE NICE TO EACH OTHER. UNLESS BEING NICE TO EACH OTHER
    WOULD CAUSE SOME SORT OF HORRIBLE PROBLEM I CANNOT ANTICIPATE RIGHT NOW. THEN
    YOU SHOULD NOT DO THAT.” “Please, O Lord! You must have more advice than that,
    advice which can sustain us in spirit as we cross this scorching desert.” “WEAR
    SUNSCREEN?” “Lord, the Egyptians are the mightiest people in the world, but they
    are mighty because their priests rule every minute of their lives, from the ritual

    them to You and thank You for your gift of freedom, I fear they will go astray.”

    theology. A lot of it wasn’t very good. The hope that they might have special
    access to God turned out to be kind of a dud. They remembered they had been created,
    way back before Time was a thing. They knew about God, they wouldn’t shut up about
    Him, but it was all incomprehensible, made the sort of mysticism humans came up
    with seem perfectly clear by comparison. An exchange of technology? The angels
    had no technology. They didn’t even seem to know many Divine Names, and the few
    they did know they wouldn’t say. Threats, blackmail, even torture seemed not to
    faze angels in the slightest, and don’t ask me to tell you the story of how we
    learned that information because this was back during the Nixon administration,
    when the country Did What It Had To Do because By Golly The Russians Would and
    We Couldn’t Fall Behind. A military alliance? Now we’re talking. The angels appeared
    to be able to smite things with flaming swords that they conjured out of nowhere.
    But they had no concept of strategy or geopolitics. When we asked if they would
    help us against the Russians, they just wanted to know if the Russians were evil.
    When we said yes, they asked why we weren’t at war with them already. When we
    tried to explain that you don’t just go to war, you build alliances and gradually
    box in your enemy and try to use their reluctance to fight to gain concessions
    from them without anything ever breaking out into open conflict which would be
    disastrous to both sides, the angels didn’t get it. Evildoer? Smite. Not an evildoer?
    Live in peace.

    “Transcendent joy!” she shouted at all the poor people trapped in the sublunary
    world, but they didn’t hear. Someone grabbed her body, the part of her that was
    stuck on the tower, the part of her that meant nothing. “Stop!” he told her, in
    a man’s voice. “You’ve got to come back!” Ana soared. She circled the Transamerica
    Pyramid, and the giant lidless eye watched her course impassively. “Listen!” said
    the man. “One plus one is two. If you don’t eat, you die. P implies not not P.
    Prices are controlled by the law of supply and demand, and are the only fair way
    of managing scarcity.” Ana began to lose altitude. “Organisms evolve according
    to the laws of natural selection. Reproductively fit organisms pass their genes
    on to the next generation. Uh. The wages of sin are death. Everybody dies. In
    a closed system, entropy always increases.” Ana flapped her arms vigorously, trying
    to regain altitude, but her flight had never come from wings to begin with, and

    you’d previously assumed was a legend used to scare children was terribly, terribly
    real. And then you wondered what else might be real. And then you started to panic.
    The hardest hit were the atheists. They’d spent their whole lives smugly telling
    everyone else that God and the Devil were fairy tales and really wasn’t it time
    to put away fairy tales and act like mature adults, and then suddenly anyone with
    a good pair of binoculars can see angels in the sky. It was rough. Rough for the
    Marxists, who had embraced it more than anyone. Rough for the scientific community,
    who had never come out and said SCIENCE PROVES THERE IS NO GOD ALSO WE ARE SMARTER
    THAN YOU but you could kind of read it between the lines. Rough for all the New
    Age hippies who were revolting against the tired old Biblical morality of their
    parents. Stephen Jay Gould, a biologist working at Harvard University, tried to
    stabilize the burgeoning philosophical disaster with his theory of “non-overlapping
    magisteria”. He said that while religion might have access to certain factual
    truths, like that angels existed or that the souls of the damned spent eternity
    writhing in a land of fire thousands of miles beneath the Earth, it was powerless
    to discuss human values and age-old questions like “what is the Good?” or “what
    is the purpose of my existence?” Atheistic science should be thought of not as
    a literal attempt to say things like “space is infinite and full of stars” or
    “humankind evolved from apes” that were now known to be untrue, but as an attempt
    to record, in the form of stories, our ancestors’ answers to those great questions.
    When a scientist says “space is infinite and full of stars”, she does not literally
    mean that the crystal sphere surrounding the Earth doesn’t exist. She is metaphorically
    referring to the infinitude of the human spirit, the limitless possibilities it
    offers, and the brightness and enlightenment waiting to be discovered. Or when
    a scientist says “humankind evolved from apes”, she is not literally doubting
    the word of the archangel Uriel that humankind was created ex nihilo on October
    13, 3761 BC and evolution added only as part of a later retconning – she is saying
    that humankind has an animal nature that it has barely transcended and to which
    it is always at risk of returning. When religious people mocked atheists for supposedly
    getting their cosmology wrong, they were missing the true grandeur and beauty
    of atheism, a grandeur which had been passed on undiminished from Democritus to
    the present day and connected us to the great thinkers of times past. Nobody was
    very impressed by these logical contortions, but for some reason a bunch of people
    kept repeating them anyway.

    of in stride right until June 1969 when the legions of Hell started swarming out
    of Lake Baikal. The Russians had been carefully guarding the borders with NATO,
    with China, and especially the Bering Strait where they almost touched America.
    They’d forgotten the oldest border of all. Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in
    the world, but it sits on a rift even deeper than that. A dozen generations of
    shamans had warned first the czar, then the communists that the rock on the island
    in the center of the lake wasn’t a rock at all so much as a plug blocking a hole
    that really needed to stay blocked, but no one had listened. Without any troops
    in their way, the demons had taken over pretty much all of Siberia east of the
    Yenisei within a year. Yakutsk was their capital, the rumors said, and had been
    the site of terrible massacres. But the demons, too, had forgotten something:
    this was Russia. What a normal country would call getting suddenly invaded by
    a vastly more powerful adversary who committed unspeakable atrocities in their
    wake, the Russians just called Tuesday. Even the nature of the foe didn’t much
    faze them; this was the fiftieth year of the Soviet state, and they’d spent so
    long hearing that their enemies were demons that it was almost an anticlimax when
    it all proved true. So the Soviets mobilized their military machine, the largest
    in the world, and trudged to the Yenesei, which they dutifully started defending.
    Another country would have called it a terrible battle that made the rivers run
    red with blood and the piled corpses reach almost to the sky. The Russians just
    called it Wednesday.'

    Virgin Communications, Virgin Games, and Virgin Atlantic Airways. What other people
    saw as the immutable will of God he saw as a business opportunity. So he teamed
    up with legendary aerospace engineer Burt Rutan to create a spacecraft capable
    of transporting a small number of lucky passengers up into the crack. And by lucky,
    he meant “very very rich”. If you can’t take it with you, you might as well give
    it to the people promising to ensure you an afterlife of eternal bliss. Thus was

    the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter Heaven, but rocketry had thirty
    years of practice working with astonishingly small tolerances and rose to meet

    canal – Panama.” We compare it to three other famous trinities. Everyone knows
    the Christian Trinity – Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. But the Buddhists have a
    similarly central concept called the Three Jewels – Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.
    The Buddha is the enlightened being. The dharma is the moral law, or the natural
    law, or duty; there’s no good English translation, so take your pick. Sangha corresponds
    almost precisely to “church”, not in the sense of a building but in the sense
    of “Catholic Church”, where it means an entire community of believers. The kabbalists
    have their own trinity: the Supernal Triad of the first three sephirot. Kether
    is the transcendent heavenly aspect of God. Binah is a perfectly receptive vessel
    sometimes likened to the uterus. And Chokmah is likened to lightning – the bolt
    that originates in Kether and strikes Binah, impregnating it with divine essence.
    These three trinities all correspond nicely to one another. They all have a human
    aspect: the Son, the Sangha, Binah, looking for answers but seeing the majesty
    of God’s plan only imperfectly. They all have an ineffable divine component: the
    Father, the Buddha, Kether, abiding in the secret order of the universe and seeing
    its full glory. And they all have a force that connects the other two: the Holy
    Spirit, the Dharma, Chokhmah, the potential for uniting the human and divine.
    Ordinary mortals. The divine order. A connection between them. A man. A plan.

    started to close. A few terrorist attacks, and they were locked tight. A few neighborhoods
    ruined, and military trucks were crossing the borders weekly to return refugees
    back to the grateful Hellish authorities. Why didn’t Thamiel take over the world?
    Some said it was weakness. Others nuclear deterrance. Still others the threat
    of the Comet King. Ever since that conversation with Ana, I’ve had a horrible
    theory of my own. Maybe God did forgive the Russians and Canadians their transgressions,
    knowing the pressures they were under. Maybe Thamiel wasn’t after the souls of
    his own citizens. Maybe the point was to damn everyone else.

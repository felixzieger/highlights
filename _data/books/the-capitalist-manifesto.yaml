    stuff. But it just does not work. Still doesn’t. There are no free lunches, and
    wealth has to be created before it can be distributed. Sooner or later you always
    run out of other people’s money, as Thatcher put it, and if you print more then
    sooner or later you’ll ruin its value.

    were identified by the British economics writer Kristian Niemietz when he studied
    how an admiring outside world viewed countries such as the Soviet Union, China,
    Cuba and Venezuela:37 Step 1: The honeymoon. The strongman distributes the country’s
    resources and Western supporters declare triumphantly that he has shown that socialism
    is superior to capitalism and should be introduced everywhere, instantly. Step
    2: The excuses. The honeymoon does not last for ever. Soon, the outside world
    receives information about how the economy doesn’t work, resources run out and
    problems pile up. Now the admirers become defensive and explain that the difficulties
    are due to bad luck, the wrong administrators ending up in the wrong places, falling
    commodity prices, bad weather that destroyed the crops, or sabotage from the elites
    or the outside world. If not for that, you would all have seen how well socialism
    works. (In Venezuela, for example: ‘They were unlucky with the oil price’ – despite
    the fact that the price in 2010 was still around six times higher than when Chávez
    took office. ‘It is because of US sanctions’ – even though sanctions against the
    oil industry were not introduced until 2019, when the collapse was already a fact.)
    Step 3: ‘It was not real socialism.’ In the end, it’s impossible to deny that
    the economy is not working, hunger is rising and people are fleeing for their
    lives. No one wants to be associated with the experiment any more. Now instead
    it is said that the country never introduced real socialism but some form of corrupt
    state capitalism that only appropriated the socialist brand, and it is intellectually
    dishonest to use that failure as evidence that socialism is not working, especially
    as real socialism right now is being developed elsewhere, in the hopeful country
    X, which you should look at instead. (At which point the foreign admirers move
    on to the next experiment and the process begins again from step 1.)'

    It is about opening the dams for human creativity – to let everyone participate
    and test their ideas and see if they work. But this is precisely why it guarantees
    a decent use of resources. We test more solutions and we get immediate feedback
    from consumers that is honest because their response is not about which project
    they think has the best intentions, think sounds convincing or has passed some
    sort of bureaucratic test, but about what they are actually willing to buy with
    their own money.

    Coffee Plan where a coffee tsar decides who will make what, when, how and at what
    price. In fact, it can only happen because there is no such coffee plan. The process
    works because each of these ten thousand people uses their individual knowledge
    of what they can do and how they can do it better. A centrally placed coffee tsar
    would never be able to centralize all this complex knowledge. Even if he had been
    able to do so, the interests, skills, supplies and circumstances would have changed
    before he had time to send out detailed orders about who should do what.

    counter and pay for your coffee. You say thank you, and the cashier answers with
    a thank-you. We hear such strange double thank-yous in all marketplaces, from
    the square where we buy vegetables and the restaurant when we pay the bill, to
    the meeting room where a contract is written with a supplier. It is not a thank-you
    followed by a ‘you are welcome’ or a ‘yes, sir’. It is a thank-you that is answered
    with a thank-you, for each party has done the other a favour. This mutual gratitude
    is the sign that you have created value for someone else.

    we replace the logic of the chop and the blow with the logic of the voluntary
    handshake. That we do not compel and command but ask, offer and negotiate. We
    do not dictate who should do what but let everyone test their ideas and keep the
    fruits of their labour if there are any. And we say no when something does not
    add anything to us.

    at the shelves of your local shop. Do you remember when you stockpiled cans, coffee
    and toilet paper when the world was closing during the first weeks of the pandemic?
    The food industry in particular was shaken by a perfect storm. New trade barriers
    were created, a large part of the workforce stayed at home while others were forbidden
    to cross national borders, and deliveries to the restaurant industry collapsed
    at the same time as demand for other food supplies soared when shoppers became
    preppers. The incredible thing about your shop shelves was that almost nothing
    happened. Through round-the-clock work to change suppliers, reallocate labour,
    adjust production methods and redirect transportation, the food industry managed
    to rebuild global supply chains in just a few weeks. It is an absolutely amazing
    achievement and we consumers noticed almost none of it. It was not done by any
    food tsar who dictated what everyone should do. It worked because it was not a
    centralized process. Each adjustment of the processes was based on local knowledge
    of what could be done in a particular place with the available raw materials and
    the workforce present – and what they could stop doing without creating catastrophic
    shortages elsewhere.

    must be very productive. They must, for example, cycle fast uphill in the rain,
    and the company must monitor them so that they know they are doing so. If you
    get the same salary no matter how fast you pedal, the slow cyclists will be thrown
    out. It thus turns out that some of the worst aspects of the gig economy are paradoxically
    the result of not having respected the flexible nature of the profession and wanting
    to regulate them as ordinary jobs. ‘And just like that, a simple bywork for anyone
    who can ride a bike, has turned into a qualified job for the strong, fast and
    physically fit,’ as economist Andreas Bergh puts

    When a housing bubble is punctured or companies face a debt crisis, the consequences
    can be dire. The only problem is that the attempts to save people from the consequences
    of their folly is to fill the world with fools.

    What that is becomes evident when you look at the extent to which the market share
    is concentrated in a small number of firms at different geographical levels. Then
    you see that market concentration increases nationally but actually decreases
    locally and regionally. It sounds contradictory but is two different ways of looking
    at the same change. If there is only one cafe in your village and suddenly a Starbucks
    opens, this means that the concentration decreases locally, but it increases nationally
    because Starbucks is already the largest cafe chain. So what looks like increased
    monopolism nationally may locally mean greater choice and increased competition.
    And that is good news because we consumers live in a local

    big bullies are just good entrepreneurs with the public interest in mind? In that
    case, I have not made myself clear. I know that some will be tempted to lie and
    deceive, and I know perfectly well that there are thieves and bandits hiding among
    the companies. That is why we must have free markets. Had we always been able
    to rely solely on their goodwill, we could have offered them monopoly power and
    tariff protection. It is precisely because we cannot count on their goodwill that
    we need to control them with free competition and consumer choice, as well as
    an independent legal system and free media.

    that has not in any way adorned itself. One hundred thousand years before the
    beauty industry told us we needed to groom and decorate ourselves, our ancestors
    were willing to offer everything they had and even risk their lives in battle
    to get coveted pigments to colour their skin. The Neanderthals had no luxury brands
    that manipulated them, but they still fought over the best eagle claws to make
    necklaces and bracelets from. Anyone who believes that consumer culture is a result
    of the pressure of commercial interests has a hard time explaining why people
    who threw off the yoke of communism immediately coveted jeans and record players.
    In the Taliban’s Afghanistan around the turn of the millennium, women went to
    underground beauty salons and painted themselves under the burqas, despite being
    threatened with flogging. The moment the Taliban fell in 2001, Afghans lined up
    to buy make-up, televisions and VCRs. Undignified, thought Western intellectuals,
    and ‘how depressing was it to see Afghan citizens celebrating the end of tyranny
    by buying consumer electronics?’ lamented one Western journalist.17 But that’s
    human nature for you, says archaeologist Brian Hayden, who has lived with indigenous
    peoples in the Middle East, the Far East, North America and Australia. It is not
    commercialism – it is us: ‘I can say categorically that the people of all the
    cultures I have come in contact with exhibit a strong desire to have the benefits
    of industrial goods that are available. I am convinced that the “nonmaterialistic
    culture” is a myth.’'

    they put their own savings in the project before they force us to chip in. The

    principle that everyone should bear the costs of their own behaviour. Polluters
    privatize profits (for example, from production or transport) but socialize costs
    (for example, through emissions that harm others, the waters they fish in or the
    climate we all depend on).
  page: Page 206

    be banned outright, such as freons in refrigerators or lead in petrol, while other
    emissions are so central to human well-being, like the greenhouse gases that our
    lifestyle relies on so far, that it is better to put a price on them so that there
    is an incentive to reduce emissions and find alternatives. This creates difficult
    demarcation problems to which I cannot give any precise answers, but the principle
    is important and, as always, it is better to be approximately right than exactly
    wrong.

    for the consequences of their actions. A tax on all forms of fossil fuels at the
    wholesale level means that the cost of them is spread to industries and consumers
    at the next level. It makes everyone feel their contribution to global warming,
    not only in their conscience but also in their wallets. It gives everyone an incentive
    to direct their consumption towards goods and services that create less greenhouse
    gases, and motivates everyone to come up with their best ideas on how to reduce
    CO2 in the cheapest way possible and develop new technologies that minimize emissions.

    one takes on a rather heavy burden of proof. Incredibly, such sweeping statements
    are only very rarely followed by attempts to document any causal link or even

    enough to prove the connection between liberalism and greed and loneliness. As

    have an awe-inspiring to-do list. But even if we were to solve all these problems,
    capitalism is not always beautiful, because we humans aren’t and even our utopias
    are built on trade-offs. The creative destruction that constantly creates wealth
    and new jobs harms those who lose the old ones. When consumers control production,
    they will demand a lot of things that are surely illegal, immoral, fattening,
    addictive, vulgar or impossible. And business owners will not hesitate to satisfy
    them and become filthy rich and buy a stupid car. Annoyingly, a disproportionately
    large proportion of those who do this are probably some old classmates of yours
    who did not understand arithmetic and did not care about ancient literature.

    the era of global capitalism, I get the response: yes, it’s good – no one is opposed
    to it – but why should we be happy with it? Why not make it even better? I agree.
    I’m not saying that’s enough. We should be proud but not content. We have begun
    to see what actually works. And that is a rare thing in human history. We must
    not take it for granted, we must make sure that it survives and spreads, precisely
    because we cannot be satisfied with the progress we have seen so far. What we
    mustn’t do is throw it all away because it is not as perfect as our fantasies.
    Without the sometimes problematic creative destruction that is constantly transforming
    our economy and technology, we will stagnate and lose the opportunity to solve
    the problems we will be surprised by in the future.'

- text: "A guide that lays out a path for meditation. My key takeaway were a simple meditation routine, I describe in this post blog.felixzieger.de/thoughts-on-meditation/ and the roles of awareness and attention in conscious experience. I read 30% or so and found it very valuable. I stopped reading because I was not interested in reading about meditation stages I felt I was still far away from."

    is never right, but prices are as right as can be hoped for at that moment. Attempts
    to coerce prices without the ability to change the reality they communicate are,
    therefore, bound to run into trouble. And yet we do not seem capable to accept
    the truth of prices whenever it is inconvenient. To ensure that consensus can
    arrive at valid social truths, we require systems or institutions that withstand
    attempts at coercion and which tap into decentralized discovery.

    hence, or the obsolescence of a new invention, or the position of private wealth
    owners in the social system in 1970. About these matters there is no scientific

- text: The most unfortunate aspect of this use of the term “competition”; is of course
    that, by referring to the situation in which no room remains for further steps
    in the competitive market process, the word has come to be understood as the very
    opposite of the kind of activity of which that process consists. Thus, as we shall
    discover, any real-world departure from equilibrium conditions came to be stamped
    as the opposite of “competitive” and hence, by simple extension, as actually “monopolistic.”

- text: In making sense of this, we have to assume some kind of “function” from the
    space of information to price. We think it is acceptable to mean this metaphorically
    for the sake of exposition, without implying the quasi-metaphysical existence
    of some such force. We might really mean something like, the market behaves as
    if operating according to such and such a function or, such and such a function
    is a reasonable low-resolution approximation of market dynamics. Adam Smith’s
    famed invisible hand is an instructive comparison. For the time being, we will
    talk as if some such function exists. We can maybe imagine information as existing
    as a vector in an incredibly high-dimensional space, at least as compared to price,
    which is clearly one dimensional. We could even account for the multitudes of
    uncertainty we have already learned to accept by suggesting that each individual’s
    subjective understanding of all the relevant factors and/or ignorance of many
    of them constitutes a unique mapping of this space to itself, such that the true
    information vector is transformed into something more personal for each market
    participant. Perhaps individuals then bring this personal information vector to
    the market, and what the market does is aggregate all the vectors by finding the
    average.[32] Finally, the market projects this n-dimensional average vector onto
    the single dimension of price. If you accept the metaphorical nature of all these
    functions, we can admit this model has some intuitive appeal, in the vein of James
    Surowiecki’s The Wisdom of Crowds. The problem is that this is clearly not how
    anybody actually interacts with markets. You don’t submit your n-dimensional information/intention
    vector; you submit your one-dimensional price. That’s it. The market aggregates
    these one-dimensional price submissions in real time by matching the flow of marginal
    bids and asks.

- text: 'Perhaps ironically, this points to the only sensible way in which markets
    can be called “efficient.” They are efficient with respect to the information
    they manipulate and convey: As a one-dimensional price, it is the absolute minimum
    required for participants to interpret and sensibly respond. Markets have excellent
    social scalability;[33] they are the original distributed systems, around long
    before anybody thought to coin that expression.'

    given a price, nobody — never mind a third-party observer or even the entire market
    — can (re)produce the information that created it. And this is the whole point.
    The “function” from information to price is not random, not ill-defined, and certainly
    not an “aggregation.” Rather, it is a very specific kind that serves a very specific
    purpose: It is the perfect compression of economically relevant information. It
    strips the noise of subjective values, preferences, and interpretations of reality
    down to pure objective signal, the same for everybody, and hence that the algorithm
    of the market can aggregate, entirely indifferent'

    nascent in the n-dimensions of their information, heuristics, judgments, and stakes,

    et al., seem to us so focused on the comparison to biological evolution, and on
    shifting the comparative conceptual framework from physics to biology as a whole,
    that they forget the role of purposeful human beings in all of this. Economic
    “mutation” is not random, it is creative, intuitive, and judgmental. It happens
    at the speed of thought because humans think on purpose. They do not cycle through

    but conscious, willful, often altruistic, inventive man. Although a marketplace
    may work mechanically, an economy is no sense a great machine. The market produces
    only the perfunctory denouement of tempestuous drama, dominated by the incalculable
    creativity of entrepreneurs, making purposeful gifts without predetermined returns,
    launching enterprise into the always unknown future. The market is the conduit,
    not the content; the low-entropy carrier, not the high-entropy message. Capitalism
    begins not with exchange but with giving, not with determinist rationality but
    with creation and surprisal.

    laws. As manifestations of the interplay of human minds, markets are more analogous
    to biological phenomena. As the controlling knowledge of economics resides deep
    inside the companies that make up the market. You cannot predict the future of
    markets or companies by examining the fractal patterns of their previous price
    movements. There is no information there.

- text: Value is subjective, which means uncertainty governs all economic phenomena.
    This creates a complexity that resists equilibria and is constantly changing besides.
    Within such a system, prices convey the minimal possible information necessary
    for economic agents to purposefully react. They do so with judgment and heuristics,
    not “perfect information,” which is nonsensical, as is “perfect competition” and
    “rational expectations.” For these reasons, prices may pass statistical tests
    for randomness, but they are not themselves random (although it is plausible that
    their randomness is random, and that randomness is random, and so on) but rather
    are unpredictable on the basis of market data alone. They are, however, predictable
    to the extent that the predictor accurately assesses the future subjective valuations
    both of economic agents and fellow market participants, and backs up this prediction
    with staked capital. This act of staking changes the uncertainties at play, rendering
    any attempt at genuinely scientific analysis futile. You can beat the market,
    it’s just hard, and it depends on understanding people, not data. And it’s meaningless
    if you do it in theory but not practice.

    be unable to form no nascent markets in which capital can be made more or less
    liquid, but not so tightly connected as to disallow differentiation in these markets.
    People need to agree enough to be able to trade but also disagree enough to be
    willing to trade. The consensus enabled by price discovery in a market really
    is a discovery, not rhetorically, but in fact: It is a distributed discovery of
    a social truth. Individuals do not find their own private truths in isolation,
    nor is a politically correct truth dictated and imposed on all. Price is the maximally
    compressed signal of economically relevant information. Entrepreneurs react to
    what information they think might be captured by the signal — what about broader
    economic reality they think this signal might mean — by manipulating whatever
    capital they can bring under their control.'

    take time and energy that might otherwise have gone towards more certain avenues
    of production. Only some small group may have the knowledge and skills to credibly
    experiment with creating a particular new tool or new organization, and they may
    not be willing to take the risks required. Some other group may have the willingness
    to take the risks but not the knowledge or skills to do so. Money provides a means

    nature, uncertain. The price of the capital they would faithfully attract can
    hardly be better described than a crowd-sourced best guess as to their risk relative
    to the opportunity set. It is possible that these guesses are conservatively false

    get a real return. Hence all return-seeking capital assets are unnaturally incentivized

    from the natural sciences, the more of a problem it becomes. A page of formulas
    just looks so impressive (Tip: for extra impressiveness, use Greek variables.)
    And so there is a great temptation to work on problems you can treat formally,
    rather than problems that are, say, important.'

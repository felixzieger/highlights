    and we had a code, but it couldn’t do many numbers, and the range of colors was
    shorter, I asked him, ‘How do you carry so much information?’” The mindreader
    was so proud of his code that he sat down and explained the whole works to my
    father. My father was a salesman. He could set up a situation like that. I can’t
    do stuff like that.

    it’s impossible to live up to it. You have no responsibility to live up to it!”
    It was a brilliant idea: You have no responsibility to live up to what other people
    think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect
    me to be. It’s their mistake, not my failing.'

    that I must refuse. The reason I have to refuse a salary like that is I would
    be able to do what I’ve always wanted to do—get a wonderful mistress, put her
    up in an apartment, buy her nice things…. With the salary you have offered, I
    could actually do that, and I know what would happen to me. I’d worry about her,
    what she’s doing; I’d get into arguments when I come home, and so on. All this
    bother would make me uncomfortable and unhappy. I wouldn’t be able to do physics
    well, and it would be a big mess! What I’ve always wanted to do would be bad for
    me, so I’ve decided that I can’t accept your offer.”

    the paper home and said to her, “I can’t understand these things that Lee and
    Yang are saying. It’s all so complicated.” “No,” she said, “what you mean is not
    that you can’t understand it, but that you didn’t invent it. You didn’t figure
    it out your own way, from hearing the clue. What you should do is imagine you’re
    a student again, and take this paper upstairs, read every line of it, and check
    the equations. Then you’ll understand it very easily.” I took her advice, and
    checked through the whole thing, and found it to be very obvious and simple. I
    had been afraid to read it, thinking it was too difficult.

    It gives somebody, individually, pleasure. You can make something that somebody
    likes so much that they’re depressed, or they’re happy, on account of that damn
    thing you made! In science, it’s sort of general and large: You don’t know the
    individuals who have appreciated it directly.'

    on a theory that there’s only X amount of stuff in the world, that somehow we
    took it away from the poorer countries in the first place, and therefore we should
    give it back to them. But this theory doesn’t take into account the real reason
    for the differences between countries—that is, the development of new techniques
    for growing food, the development of machinery to grow food and to do other things,
    and the fact that all this machinery requires the concentration of capital. It
    isn’t the stuff, but the power to make the stuff, that is important.

    at it, you don’t improve your knowledge of the situation by averaging.

- text: 'Disaster at sea can happen in a moment, without warning, or it can come after
    long days of anticipation and fear. It does not always come when the sea is fiercest
    but may spring when waters lie as flat and imperturbable as a sheet of iron. Sailors
    may be struck down at any time, in calm or in storm, but the sea does not do it
    for hate or spite. She has no wrath to vent. Nor does she have a hand of kindness
    to extend. She is merely there, immense, powerful, and indifferent. I do not resent
    her indifference, or my comparative insignificance. Indeed, it is one of the main
    reasons I like to sail: the sea makes the insignificance of my own small self
    and of all humanity so poignant.'

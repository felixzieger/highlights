    it, of course,’ she said, and now she began to understand the fear in his voice,
    drawn into this thing against her will. ‘When the sandtrout go, so do all the
    worms,’ he said. ‘The tribes must be warned.’ ‘No more spice,’ she said. Words
    merely touched high points of the system danger which they both saw hanging over
    human intrusion into Dune’s ancient relationships. ‘It’s the thing Alia knows,’
    he said. ‘It’s why she gloats.’ ‘How can you be sure of that?’ ‘I’m sure.’ Now
    she knew for certain what disturbed him, and she felt the knowledge chill her.
    ‘The tribes won’t believe us if she denies it,’ he said. His statement went to
    the primary problem of their existence: What Fremen expected wisdom from a nine-year-old?
    Alia, growing farther and farther from her own inner sharing each day, played
    upon this. ‘We must convince Stilgar,’ Ghanima said. As one, their heads turned
    and they stared out over the moonlit desert. It was a different place now, changed
    by just a few moments of awareness. Human interplay with that environment had
    never been more apparent to them. They felt themselves as integral parts of a
    dynamic system held in delicately balanced order. The new outlook involved a real
    change of consciousness which flooded them with observations.'

    the ability to transform melange into a vision of the future. With the spice,
    he could breathe the future, shatter Time’s veils. He found the temptation difficult
    to shed, clasped his hands and sank into the prana-bindu awareness. His flesh
    negated the temptation. His flesh wore the deep knowledge learned in blood by
    Paul. Those who sought the future hoped to gain the winning gamble on tomorrow’s
    race. Instead they found themselves trapped into a lifetime whose every heartbeat
    and anguished wail was known. Paul’s final vision had shown the precarious way
    out of that trap, and Leto knew now that he had no other choice but to follow
    that way. ‘The joy of living, its beauty is all bound up in the fact that life
    can surprise you,’ he said.

    ‘Alia resisted. That gave the powers within her their strength. By their own strength
    she was overcome. We’ve dared to search within, to seek out the old languages
    and the old knowledge. We’re already amalgams of those lives within us. We don’t
    resist; we ride with them. This was what I learned

    certain advanced training by which your character might evolve.

    locked into that future to the exclusion of any freedom to change.’ ‘The paradox
    which is our problem,’ Leto said. ‘It’s a subtle and powerful thing, prescience.
    The future becomes now. To be sighted in the land of the blind carries its own
    perils. If you try to interpret what you see for the blind, you tend to forget
    that the blind possess an inherent movement conditioned by their blindness. They
    are like a monstrous machine moving along its own path. They have their own momentum,
    their own fixations. I fear the blind, Stil. I fear them. They can so easily crush
    anything in their path.’

    Sietch Tabr. Such talk always disturbed him. Leto sensed the sweaty smell of Stilgar’s
    movement. It was such a temptation to avoid the purposeful things which had to
    be said here. They could talk half the day away, moving from the specific to the
    abstract as though drawn away from real decisions, from those immediate necessities
    which confronted them.

    now. Before Muad’Dib, Stilgar saw, the Fremen had been conditioned to believe
    in failure, never in the possibility of accomplishment. Well… they’d believed
    Liet-Kynes, but he’d set a forty-generation timescale. That was no accomplishment;
    that was a dream which, he saw now, had also turned inward. Muad’Dib had changed
    that!

    be denied. What other function did the priesthood serve than to deny individual
    will? Alia kept saying that opportunities for open competition had to be reduced
    to manageable limits. But that meant the recurrent threat of technology could
    only be used to confine populations – just as it had served its ancient masters.
    Any permitted technology had to be rooted in ritual. Otherwise… otherwise…

    civilizations and governments.’ Dangerous or not, there would be change. The beautiful
    young Fremen knew this. They could look outward and see it, prepare for it. Stilgar
    was forced to stop. It was either that or walk right over Leto. The youth peered
    up at him owlishly, said: ‘You see, Stil? Tradition isn’t the absolute guide you
    thought it was.’'

    They set the pieces out in the desert to be etched by stormsands. Sometimes they

    genuine storm-etched marble from Dune. I bought a piece of it last week – a golden
    tree with five tassels, lovely but very fragile.’ ‘Don’t change the subject,’
    Alia said. ‘I haven’t changed the subject,’ he said. ‘It’s beautiful, but it’s
    not art. Humans'

    but the effects of the Butlerian Jihad continued as a damper on technological
    excesses. Ixians, Tleilaxu, and a few scattered outer planets were the only possible
    threat in this regard, and they were planet-vulnerable to the combined wrath of
    the rest of the Imperium. The Butlerian Jihad would not be undone. Mechanized
    warfare required a large technical class. The Atreides Imperium had channeled
    this force into other pursuits. No large technical class existed unwatched. And
    the Empire remained safely feudalist, naturally, since that was the best social
    form for spreading over widely dispersed wild frontiers – new planets.

- text: In all major socializing forces you will find an underlying movement to gain
    and maintain power through the use of words. From witch doctor to priest to bureaucrat
    it is all the same. A governed populace must be conditioned to accept power-words
    as actual things, to confuse the symbolized system with the tangible universe.
    In the maintenance of such a power structure, certain symbols are kept out of
    the reach of common understanding – symbols such as those dealing with economic
    manipulation of those which define the local interpretation of sanity. Symbol-secrecy
    of this form leads to the development of fragmented sub-languages, each being
    a signal that its users are accumulating some form of power. With this insight
    into a power process, our Imperial Security Force must be ever alert to the formation
    of sub-languages. –Lecture to the Arrakeen War College,

    mystery about this at the moment. This is what we want now. It may prove wrong

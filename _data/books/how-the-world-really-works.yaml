    is due to special power subsidies, and progress evaporates whenever and wherever
    they are removed.”[22] And, more recently, physicist Robert Ayres has repeatedly
    stressed in his writings the central notion of energy in all economies: “the economic
    system is essentially a system for extracting, processing and transforming energy
    as resources into energy embodied in products and services.”[23] Simply put, energy
    is the only truly universal currency, and nothing (from galactic rotations to
    ephemeral insect lives) can take place without its transformations.'

    to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. We do
    not have a picture that energy comes in little blobs of a definite amount. It
    is not that way. However, there are formulas for calculating some numerical quantity,
    and when we add it all together it gives . . . always the same number. It is an
    abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanism or the reasons for the
    various formulas.'

    to one of the most insightful physicists of the 20th century—to the protean mind
    of Richard Feynman, who (in his famous Lectures on Physics) tackled the challenge
    in his straightforward manner, stressing that “energy has a large number of different
    forms, and there is a formula for each one. These are: gravitational energy, kinetic
    energy, heat energy, elastic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, radiant
    energy, nuclear energy, mass energy.” And then comes this disarming but indubitable
    conclusion: It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge
    of what energy is. We do not have a picture that energy comes in little blobs

    far better than others. The high densities of chemical energy in kerosene and
    diesel fuel are great for intercontinental flying and shipping, but if you want
    your submarine to stay submerged while crossing the Pacific Ocean then the best
    choice is to fission enriched uranium in a small reactor in order to produce electricity.[32]
    And back on land, large nuclear reactors are the most reliable producers of electricity:
    some of them now generate it 90–95 percent of the time, compared to about 45 percent
    for the best offshore wind turbines and 25 percent for photovoltaic cells in even
    the sunniest of climates—while Germany’s solar panels produce electricity only
    about 12 percent of the time.'

- text: Energy is a scalar, which in physics is a quantity described only by its magnitude;
    volume, mass, density, time, and speed are other ubiquitous scalars. Power measures
    energy per unit of time and hence it is a rate (in physics, a rate measures change,
    commonly per time).

- text: There are enormous opportunities to generate more electricity with photovoltaic
    cells and wind turbines, but there is a fundamental difference between systems
    that derive 20–40 percent of electricity from these intermittent sources (Germany
    and Spain are the best examples among large economies) and a national electricity
    supply that relies completely on these renewable flows.

    to rise, meeting the demand of an economically reforming China as well as the
    rising demand elsewhere in Asia—but oil has not regained its pre-1975 relative
    dominance.[49] Its share of the global commercial primary energy supply fell from
    45 percent in 1970 to 38 percent in the year 2000 and to 33 percent in 2019—and
    it is now certain that its further relative decline will continue as natural gas
    consumption and wind and solar electricity generation keep increasing.

    have called the four pillars of modern civilization: cement, steel, plastics,
    and ammonia.[4] Physically and chemically, these four materials are distinguished
    by an enormous diversity of properties and functions. But despite these differences
    in attributes and specific uses, they share more than their indispensability for
    the functioning of modern societies. They are needed in larger (and still increasing)
    quantities than are other essential inputs. In 2019, the world consumed about
    4.5 billion tons of cement, 1.8 billion tons of steel, 370 million tons of plastics,
    and 150 million tons of ammonia, and they are not readily replaceable by other
    materials—certainly not in the near future or on a global scale.'
  page: Page 99
- text: Modern economies will always be tied to massive material flows, whether those
    of ammonia-based fertilizers to feed the still-growing global population; plastics,
    steel, and cement needed for new tools, machines, structures, and infrastructures;
    or new inputs required to produce solar cells, wind turbines, electric cars, and
    storage batteries. And until all energies used to extract and process these materials
    come from renewable conversions, modern civilization will remain fundamentally
    dependent on the fossil fuels used in the production of these indispensable materials.
    No AI, no apps, and no electronic messages will change that.

    warming), ocean acidification (endangering marine organisms that build structures
    of calcium carbonate), depletion of stratospheric ozone (shielding the Earth from
    excessive ultraviolet radiation and threatened by releases of chlorofluorocarbons),
    atmospheric aerosols (pollutants reducing visibility and causing lung impairment),
    interference in nitrogen and phosphorus cycles (above all, the release of these
    nutrients into fresh and coastal waters), freshwater use (excessive withdrawals

    how difficult it would be to codify such principles and to follow such guidelines

    Corporation (PTC) is a computer-aided-design software company with a legendary
    sales culture. My head of sales at Opsware, culture-changer Mark Cranney, came
    from PTC and was always bragging about how good they were at selling. I got annoyed
    and asked why they were so great. He said, “Well, it started with the interview.
    I walked into the interview with the senior vice president of sales, John McMahon.
    He said nothing for what seemed like five minutes, then asked me, ‘What would
    you do if I punched you in the face right now?’” At this point in Mark’s story,
    I cried, “What!? He wanted to know what you would do if he punched you in the
    face? That’s crazy. What did you say?” Mark said, “I asked him, ‘Are you testing
    my intelligence or my courage?’ And McMahon said, ‘Both.’ So I said, ‘Well, you’d
    better knock me out.‘ He said, ‘You’re hired.’ Right then I knew that I’d found
    a home.”

    powers that be.‘ This is absolutely toxic to the culture. Everyone on the team
    will feel marginalized because they work for someone who’s powerless. This makes
    them one level less than powerless. They have just been demoted from the bottom
    of the totem pole to the ground beneath it.

- text: Capitalist economy is strikingly characterized by a special kind of periodic
    economic crisis, not met with or occurring only very rarely and on limited scales
    in other types of society. These capitalist crises of production have no relation
    either to “natural catastrophes” (drought, famine, plague, etc.) or to people’s
    biological and psychological needs for the goods that might be turned out, one
    or the other of which determined most crises in other types of society. The capitalist
    crises are determined by economic relations and forces. It is not necessary for
    our purpose to enter into the disputed question of the exact causes of the crises;
    whatever account is given, no one denies their reality, their periodic occurrence,
    and their basic difference from dislocations of production and consumption in
    other types of society.

- text: An “ideology” is similar in the social sphere to what is sometimes called
    “rationalization” in the sphere of individual psychology. An ideology is not a
    scientific theory, but is nonscientific and often antiscientific. It is the expression
    of hopes, wishes, fears, ideals, not a hypothesis about events—though ideologies
    are often thought by those who hold them to be scientific theories.

- text: 'Among the elements entering into the ideologies typical of capitalist society,
    there must be prominently included, though it is not so easy to define what we
    mean by it, individualism. Capitalist thought, whether reflected in theology or
    art or legal, economic, and political theory, or philosophy or morality, has exhibited
    a steady concentration on the idea of the “individual.” We find the “individual”
    wherever we turn: in Luther’s appeal to “private interpretation” of the Bible
    as the test of religious truth;'
  page: Page 27
- text: According to the prevailing capitalist idea, the fundamental unit of politics,
    psychology, sociology, morality, theology, economics was thought of as the single
    human individual. This individual was understood as complete “in himself,” in
    his own nature, and as having only external relations to other persons and things.
    Though Hegel and his followers notoriously reject this conception, it is unquestionably
    typical, and is implicit where not explicit in most of the influential doctrines
    and public documents of the fields just mentioned. The Church, the state, the
    ideal utopia, are not realities in themselves but only numerical sums of the individuals
    who compose them.
  page: Page 27
- text: 'Finally, in capitalist society, the theological and supernatural interpretation
    of the meaning of world history was replaced by the idea of progress, first appearing
    in the writers of the Renaissance and being given definite formulation during
    the eighteenth century. There were two factors in the idea of progress: first,
    that mankind was advancing steadily and inevitably to better and better things;
    and, second, the definition of the goal toward which the advance is taking place
    in naturalistic terms, in terms we might say of an earthly instead of a heavenly
    paradise.'

- text: If socialism is to come, the working class, as we have seen, has always, and
    rightly, been held to be the primary social group which will have a hand in its
    coming. According to Marx himself, the inherent development of capitalist society
    as it tended toward centralization and monopoly was such that there would take
    place the “proletarianization” of the overwhelming bulk of the population; that

    since social relations are ultimately a question of relative power, is equally
    decisive as a mark of the deterioration in the social position of the working
    class.

    among organized groups of men.

    from hitting him; “struggle” means literal and direct physical encounter, and
    we can easily observe who wins such a struggle. But “defense” and “struggle” in
    the case of social groups—classes or nations or races or whatever the groups may
    be—are far more complicated matters. Such words are, when applied to groups, metaphors.
    This does not mean, as we are told by our popularizing semanticists who do not
    understand what semantics teaches, that we ought not use such words. It means
    only that we must be careful, that we must not take the metaphor as expressing
    a full identity, that we must relate our words to what actually happens.

- text: First, that the net result in terms of alterations of the structure of society
    was to benefit, above all, the bourgeoisie, as against all other sections of society,
    and to leave the bourgeoisie ever more securely the ruling class in society. Second,
    the bulk of the actual fighters were not themselves capitalists. Presumably, at
    least where it was not a matter of direct compulsion, most of those who fought
    believed that they did so for ends which were beneficial to themselves; but, at
    least so far as economic and social benefit went, this turned out, for the non-bourgeois
    bulk of the fighters, either not to be the case at all or at least far secondary
    to the benefit resulting to the capitalists. Similar remarks apply to the development
    of the new ideologies. From the time of the Renaissance a number of more or less
    related new ideologies—religions, philosophies, moralities, theories of law and
    politics and society—were developed, and some of them became widely believed.
    None of these ideologies spoke openly in the name of the bourgeoisie; none of
    them said that the best kind of society and politics and morality and religion
    and universe was one in which the capitalists were the ruling class; they spoke,
    as all important ideologies do, in the name of “truth” and for the ostensible
    welfare of all mankind.

- text: It must be stressed that the building of bourgeois dominance began and was
    carried far within feudalism, while the structure of society was predominantly
    feudal in character, while, in particular, the political, religious, and educational
    institutions were still controlled in the primary interests of the feudal lords.
    This was possible because society accorded the capitalists, at least to a sufficient
    extent, those “rights” necessary for carrying on capitalist enterprise—of contract,
    of taking interest, hiring free workers for wages, etc.—in spite of the fact that
    most of these rights were directly forbidden by feudal law, custom, and philosophy
    (often, as in the case of taking interest, pious formulas were used to get around
    the prohibitions), and in spite of the fact that the wide extension of capitalist
    relations meant necessarily the destruction of the social dominance of the feudal
    lords.

    a state which, by and large, most of the time and on the most important occasions,
    upholds those rights, those ways of acting and thinking, which are such as to
    permit

    a point to which we shall return later. The different things which these different
    groups do promote in their respective members different attitudes, habits of thought,
    ideals, ways and methods of solving problems. To put it crudely: the managers
    tend to think of solving social and political problems as they co-ordinate and
    organize the actual process of production; the nonmanagerial executives think
    of society as a price-governed profit-making animal; the finance-capitalists think
    of problems in terms of what happens in banks and stock exchanges and security
    flotations; the little stockholders think of the economy as a mysterious god who,
    if placated properly, will hand out free gifts to the deserving.'

- text: These two rights (control of access and preferential treatment in distribution)
    are fundamental in ownership and, as we have noted, determine the dominant or
    ruling class in society—which consists simply of the group that has those rights,
    or has them, at least, in greater measure than the rest of society, with respect
    to the chief instruments of production.
  page: Page 91
- text: But if we reinterpret the phrase “separation of ownership and control” to
    mean “separation of control over access from control over preferential treatment
    in distribution”—and this is partly what lies back of the Berle and Means analysis—then
    we are confronted
  page: Page 92
- text: The contention of the last chapter that control over the instruments of production
    is everywhere undergoing a shift, away from the capitalists proper and toward
    the managers, will seem to many fantastic and naïve, especially if we are thinking
    in the first instance of the United States. Consider, it will be argued, the growth
    of monopoly in our time. Think of the Sixty Families, with their billions upon
    billions of wealth, their millions of shares of stock in the greatest corporations,
    and their lives which exceed in luxury and display anything even dreamed of by
    the rulers of past ages. The managers, even the chief of them, are only the servants,
    the bailiffs of the Sixty Families. How absurd to call the servant, master! Such
    would have been the comment—except, perhaps, of a few in a few small towns—Florence,
    Genoa, Venice, Bruges, Augsburg—if anyone had in the early fifteenth century been
    so much a dreamer as to suggest that control was then shifting from the feudal
    lords toward the small, dull, vulgar group of merchants and traders and moneylenders.

    them, in fact not in name, controls society,

    into its ranks is correctly recognized by many sociologists as an important symptom
    of the decadence of that class and its approaching downfall.

- text: In capitalist society, the role of government in the economy is always secondary.
    The government acts in the economy chiefly to preserve the integrity of the market
    and of capitalist property relations, and to give aid and comfort, as in wars
    or international competition or internal disturbances, where these are needed.
    This we have noted in describing the general features of capitalist society. This
    restriction in the government’s sphere of activity—whatever the form of the government,
    dictatorial or democratic, in the political sphere—is not a coincidence, but,
    it must be stressed again, an integral part of the whole social structure of capitalism.
    Capitalist economy is a system of private ownership, of ownership of a certain
    type vested in private individuals, of private enterprise. The capitalist state
    is therefore, and necessarily, a limited state.
  page: Page 102
- text: you cannot call an economy of state ownership capitalist, because in it there
    are no capitalists A capitalist is one who, as an individual, has ownership interest
    in the instruments of production; who, as an individual, employs workers, pays
    them wages, and is entitled to the products of their labor.
  page: Page 115
- text: 'There are many millions of persons and many groups in the world today who
    consciously advocate state ownership of the instruments of production. They do
    so out of a variety of motives: some because they think it will bring a classless
    society and freedom, others because they think it will make possible universal
    material well-being, others from even more abstractly moral reasons. The attitude
    and actions of these persons and groups are one of the important social forces
    tending to bring about state ownership. Nevertheless, the result of state ownership
    does not depend upon the motives from which these persons advocate it.'
  page: Page 123
- text: Many persons want state ownership and control, but the tendency toward state
    ownership and control is not by any means dependent exclusively on the fact that
    many people want it and deliberately work toward it. There are persons who want
    to revive feudalism, who would like socialism, no doubt even those who wish for
    chattel slavery; but actual conditions prevent their wants from having any chance
    of being realized. The circumstances, problems, and difficulties of the present,
    however, all combine to furnish soil on which state ownership and control grow
    rapidly. Private enterprise proves unable to keep the productive process going;
    the state therefore steps in. Modern total war demands the co-ordination of the
    economy; this can be done only through state control. Private investment dries
    up; state investment takes its place. Private enterprise fails to take care of
    the unemployed; the state gives them jobs.

  page: Page 125
- text: Managerial economy would not be going to replace capitalist economy unless
    it could solve, at least in some measure, those key difficulties (which we noticed
    in Chapter III) that are faced by capitalism and make impossible the continuance
    of capitalism. We know, without waiting for the future, that managerial economy
    can do away with mass unemployment or reduce it to a negligible minimum. This
    was done, by managerial methods, in Russia and Germany at the same time that England,
    France, and the United States proved incapable of doing it by capitalist methods.
    The question here is not whether we “approve” of the way in which mass unemployment
    was or will be got rid of. We may think that unemployment is preferable to, for
    example, conscript labor battalions. Nevertheless, mass unemployment is the most
    intolerable of all the difficulties that any economy can face, sufficient, by
    itself, to guarantee the collapse of an economic system; and we are concerned
    with the fact, already sufficiently proved, that managerial methods and managerial
    economic relations can get rid of unemployment, whereas capitalist methods no
    longer can do so.

- text: Put in the crudest way, there will continue to be, as there has always been
    in human history, fighting over the spoils. The fight may translate, and thereby
    partly hide, itself into political and juridical, as well as physical, forms that
    we do not as yet suspect, but it will go on. And this is sufficient reason, if
    there were no others, why we should have as little faith in the promises of the
    ideologies of the managers—fascist or Leninist or Stalinist or New Dealer or technocratic—as
    we ought to have learned to have in those of the capitalists, when they tell us
    that following their pipe will guarantee

- text: Any organised society patterns its life according to certain rules—customs,
    laws, decrees. These rules may not be written down, may not be explicitly formulated
    even in verbal terms, but they must exist or there would be no sense in calling
    the society organized. The origin of many of the rules, at any given moment, is
    lost in a remote past; but there must be within the society some mechanism for
    enforcing those taken over from the past, and, since the rules are always changing
    and being added to or dropped, for stating and enforcing new or changed rules.
    A social group which makes and enforces its own rules for itself, and does not
    recognize rules made for it by an agency outside the group, is called “autonomous”
    or “sovereign”—such as the capitalist nations all claimed to be and the chief
    of them in fact were.
  page: Page 134
- text: The “sovereignty” of the group, by virtue of which rules are made, cannot,
    however, simply float in the group air. It must be localized, concretized, in
    some human institution which is accepted as the institution from which rules (in
    complex society called “laws”) come.

    have meant to the Greeks who invented it) is the granting of the right of political
    expression to minorities. More fully: democracy is a political system where policy
    is decided, directly or indirectly, by a majority, and where minorities, differing
    in their opinion from the majority, have the right of political expression and
    the opportunity, thereby, of becoming a majority.'
  page: Page 157
- text: Furthermore, there are always, in fact, restrictions about the limits of democratically
    acceptable opposition. When the minority goes beyond these limits it is not given
    rights to propagate its views but suppressed as “subversive” or “criminal” or
    “vicious.”
  page: Page 158
- text: Discontent and opposition, under an absolute dictatorship, having no mechanism
    for orderly expression, tend to take terroristic and, in times of crisis, revolutionary
    forms. The example of capitalist parliaments shows how well democratic possibilities
    are able to make discontent and opposition harmless by providing them with an
    outlet.

- text: Sovereignty for a nation implies that the nation makes laws for itself and
    recognizes no superior lawmaker. It means that the nation sets up tariffs and
    other import and export controls, regulates its own foreign policies and its own
    currency, and maintains civil, diplomatic, and military establishments. The simultaneous
    existence of many sovereign nations in the modern world necessarily means an anarchic
    situation in world politics. This must be because, since each sovereign nation
    recognizes no lawmaker superior to itself, there is in the end no way except by
    force to mediate the deep conflicts that are bound to arise among the various
    nations.

    threat of force, and by established patterns of institutional behavior, but also

    considered scientific by those who believe in them.'

    chapter, were variants on the themes of: individualism; opportunity; “natural
    rights,” especially the rights of property; freedom, especially “freedom of contract”;
    private enterprise; private initiative; and so on. These ideologies conformed
    well to the two requirements stated above. Under the interpretations given them,
    they expressed and served the interests of the capitalists. They justified profit
    and interest. They showed why the owner of the instruments of production was entitled
    to the full product of those instruments and why the worker had no claim on the
    owner except for the contracted wages. They preserved the supremacy of the field
    of private enterprise. They kept the state to its limited role.'

    life to stop the Nazi assumption of power; Hitler took power without a civil war.
    The capitalist ideologies did not provide a sufficient incentive for heroism.
    In the Saar and in the Sudetenland, the masses had had their experience of capitalism
    and capitalist democracy. They chose Hitler and Nazism. There is not the slightest
    doubt that overwhelming majorities in both were in favor of becoming part of Hitler’s
    Germany. It may be granted that terrorism and skilled propaganda methods played
    some part in influencing opinion. But to imagine that these were the full explanation
    would be shallow and absurd. Terrorism and skilled technique cannot by themselves
    put across an ideology that has no roots in mass appeal. The fact is that Nazism
    was preferred by the masses to the capitalist ideologies.

    of fascist and communist analyses could usually be interchanged without anyone’s
    being able to tell which came from which. This holds for the critiques of capitalist
    economy, politics, and ideologies. The two ideologies are the same also—and this
    is most influential in developing patterns of attitude—in their scorn and contempt
    for “capitalist morality,” in their scathing dismissal of “natural rights” as
    capitalism understands these rights. They unite to attack “individualism,” root
    and branch. In both ideologies, the “state,” the “collectivity,” “planning,” “co-ordination,”
    “socialism,” “discipline” replace the “individual,” “free enterprise,” “opportunity,”
    as attitude-terms to hammer into the consciousness of the masses. Fascist and
    communist ideologies denounce in the same words the “chaos” and “anarchy” of capitalism.
    They conceive of the organization of the state of the future, their state, exactly
    along the lines on which a manager, an engineer, organizes a factory; that is,
    their conception of the state is a social extension generalized from managerial
    experience. And they have identical conceptions of “the party”—their party, with
    a monopoly in the political field.

    the development of attitudes and patterns of response which are adverse to the
    continuance of capitalism and favorable to the development of managerial society,
    which are adverse to the continued social acceptance of the rule of the capitalists,
    and favorable to the social acceptance of the rule of the managers.'

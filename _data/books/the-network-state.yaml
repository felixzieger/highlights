    are unreliable and often intentionally misleading. Epic, because the timescales
    are so long that you have to consciously sample beyond your own experience and
    beyond any human lifetime to see patterns. Twisting, because there are curves,
    cycles, collapses, and non-straightforward patterns. And trajectories, because
    history is ultimately about the time evolution of human beings, which maps to
    the physical idea of a dynamical system, of a set of particles progressing through
    time.

    order will remain basically stable over the short-term, and the complementary
    view of a long-term “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward
    justice.” It also contests the idea that the fall of the bourgeoisie “and the
    victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable,” or that “no two countries
    on a Bitcoin standard will go to war with each other,” or even that technological
    progress has been rapid, so we can assume it will continue and society will not
    collapse. Those phrases come from different ideologies, but each of them verbally
    expresses the clean parabolic arc of the rock.

    on the premises of Twitter and Facebook and Google. The posts are typically not
    digitally signed or cryptographically timestamped, so much of the content is (or
    could be) from bots rather than humans. Inconvenient digital history can be deleted
    by putting sufficient pressure on centralized social media companies or academic
    publishers, censoring true information in the name of taking down “disinformation,”
    as we’ve already seen. And the advent of AI allows highly realistic fakes of the
    past and present to be generated. If we’re not careful, we could drown in fake
    data.

- text: The thing is, essentially all of human behavior has a digital component now.
    Every purchase and communication, every ride in an Uber, every swipe of a keycard,
    and every step with a Fitbit — all of that produces digital artifacts. So, in
    theory you could eventually download the public blockchain of a network state
    to replay the entire cryptographically verified history of a community.25 That’s
    the future of public records, a concept that is to the paper-based system of the
    legacy state what paper records were to oral records. It’s also a vision for what
    macrohistory will become. Not a scattered letter from an Abelard here and a stone
    tablet from an Egyptian there. But a full log, a cryptohistory. The unification
    of microhistory and macrohistory in one giant cryptographically verifiable dataset.
    We call this indelible, computable, digital, authenticatable history the ledger
    of record. This concept is foundational to the network state. And it can be used
    for good or ill. In decentralized form, the ledger of record allows an individual
    to resist the Stalinist rewriting of the past. It is the ultimate expression of
    the bottom-up view of history as what’s written to the ledger. But you can also
    imagine a bastardized form, where the cryptographic checks are removed, the read/write
    access is centralized, and the idea of a total digital history is used by a state
    to create an NSA/China-like system of inescapable, lifelong surveillance.

    the enemy and to justify military action is the atrocity story. This technique,
    says Professor Lasswell, has been used “with unvarying success in every conflict
    known to man.” The concept is as useful in peacetime as it is in war. Why? Because
    states get their people hyped up to fight wars by stressing the essentially defensive
    nature of what they are doing and the savage behavior of the enemy. But war is
    politics by other means, so politics is war by other means. Even in peacetime,
    the state is predicated on force. And this use of force requires justification.
    The atrocity story is the tool used to convince people that the use of state force
    is legitimate.
  page: Page 59
- text: Somewhat toned-down versions of the atrocity story are the go-to technique
    used to justify expansions of political power. If we don’t force people to take
    off their shoes at the airport, people will die! If we don’t stop people from
    voluntarily taking experimental curative drugs, people will die! If we don’t set
    up a disinformation office to stop people from making hostile comments online,
    people will die! Indeed, almost everything in politics is backed by an atrocity
    story.28 There’s a sometimes real, sometimes fake, sometimes exaggerated Girardian
    founding murder (or at least founding injury) behind much of what the government
    does. Sometimes the atrocity story is framed in terms of terrorists, sometimes
    in terms of children…but the general concept is “something so bad happened, we
    must use (state) force to prevent it from happening again.” Often this completely
    ignores the death caused by that force itself.

    technologically feasible as an organizing system for humanity. Thus: political

    regardless of what people believe? A political truth is true if everyone believes
    it to be true. Things like money, status, and borders are in this category. You
    can change these by rewriting facts in people’s brains. For example, the question
    of what a dollar is worth, who the president is, and where the border of a country
    is are all dependent on the ideas installed in people’s heads. If enough people
    change their minds, markets move, presidents change, and borders shift.37 Conversely,
    a technical truth is true even if no human believes it to be true. Facts in math,
    physics, and biochemistry are in this category. They exist independent of what’s
    in people’s brains. For example, what’s the value of π, the speed of light, or
    the diameter of a virus?'

    have a pithy saying: the backwards will be beaten. If you’re bad at technology,
    you’ll be beaten politically. Conversely, the Americans also have a saying: “you
    and what army?” It doesn’t matter how good you are as an individual technologist
    if you’re badly outnumbered politically. And if you’re unpopular enough, you won’t
    have the political power to build in the physical world.'

    put it, no amount of violence can solve certain kinds of math problems. So it
    doesn’t matter how many nuclear weapons you have; if property or information is
    secured by cryptography, the state can’t seize it without getting the solution
    to an equation.

    sometimes it’s quasi-voluntary. Indeed, one thesis on why many of the major tech
    founders have stepped down as of mid-2022, other than Zuck, is that they don’t
    want to become personally demonized during the no-win antitrust process. It’s
    more explicit in China that this wasn’t a choice — Jack Ma is no longer in control
    of the company he founded, and many other Chinese founders have been similarly
    relieved of their duties. In other words, both the Chinese and American establishments
    have invented rationales to essentially seize previously founder-controlled companies.49
    That is, whatever the surface justification, these are hostile takeovers of centralized
    tech companies by centralized states.

    to build a startup society, but you do need a moral innovation of some kind. If
    all you have to offer is a higher standard of living, people may come as consumers,
    but they won’t come for the right reasons. The consumer-citizen is coming to enjoy
    a great society, not to sacrifice to make a society great. They won’t understand
    the values that underpin your startup society’s valuation. And you likely won’t
    be able to build that high valuation or higher standard of living without a higher
    purpose, just as neither Apple nor America itself was initially built for money
    alone. You want to recruit producers, not consumers, and for that, you’ll need
    a purpose.

    State, which is very real and can do violence against its/their enemies, as opposed
    to what they think of as an imaginary God. This is why State-worshippers mock
    the concept of “thoughts and prayers” in favor of “passing a law.” The State exists,
    after all, and can organize people to apply coercive force. But God’s vehicle,
    the church, no longer has enough belief behind it (in the West at least) to do
    the same. This is also why left-authoritarians tend to take for granted that all
    ills can be solved by “praying for relief” to the State, by forming some agency,
    by appropriating ever more money. Taxes are secular tithes, and the Gov-fearing
    man is like the God-fearing man — you simply cannot pay enough money and respect
    to the state, because as the DNC video says outright, “government is the one thing
    we all belong to.” It’s not about results, it’s about fealty.

    from randomly blowing up the Middle East, it’s tough to argue that you’d still
    want the Soviet Union to still be around to limit US military intervention. Similarly,
    it’s hard to contend that the price of constraining China’s lawful evil ambitions
    in East Asia should be tolerance for America’s chaotic evil interventions in the
    Middle East, that defending against a potential Chinese drone armada should mean
    acceptance of endless destabilization by the US military. Ideally there’s a third
    way, a better choice - and that third way may simply be decentralized defense,
    where countries like Japan and Germany re-arm, rather than outsourcing everything
    to the US or folding to China. This has its own issues, of course — but if we’re
    moving back into the 1800s and 1700s, as per the Future is Our Past thesis, limited
    wars between gold-limited great powers are arguably preferable to gigantic global
    conflicts between unlimited superpowers.

    decentralization (transistor, personal computer, internet, remote work, smartphone,

    communist revolutions which killed tens of millions of people globally, led to
    “lasting disorders and attacks upon property”, and generally became the bane of
    the world. We can attribute some of this to the pause, to the closing of the frontier
    in 1890. That closing took away paths for ambitious men, and ensured that they
    couldn’t easily become founders on their own plot of land - they had to become
    union organizers, or revolutionaries, or demagogues of some kind. Without the
    frontier, it all became zero sum.

- text: The political arbitrage of supporting those with low status and attacking
    those with high status is typically framed as a moral imperative, while the financial
    arbitrage of buying assets with low value and selling assets of high value is
    usually portrayed as a dispassionate mechanism for gaining financial capital.
    But recall that people do sometimes make moral arguments for buying low and selling
    high (“it helps markets become more efficient”). So you might invert the mood
    of the words on the other side too, and think of “afflicting the comfortable and
    comforting the afflicted” as a dispassionate mechanism for gaining political capital.
  page: Page 172
- text: And if these startup societies are built out on the frontier, whether digital
    or physical, then the moral innovations are no longer imposed top-down, but adopted
    bottom-up by the people who opt in. That gives a better way to achieve the goals
    of ambitious young political reformers.

- text: The frontier means the revolutionary is simultaneously less practically obstructed
    in their path to reform (because the ruling class can’t stop them from leaving
    for the frontier and taking unhappy citizens with them), but also more ethically
    constrained (because the revolutionary can’t simply impose their desired reforms
    by fiat, and must instead gain express consent by having people opt into their
    jurisdiction). These are, however, reasonable tradeoffs. So while the frontier
    is not a panacea, it is at least a pressure valve. That’s why reopening the frontier
    may be the most important meta-political thing we can do to reduce political conflict.

    Republican Conservative, Soviet Nationalist, CCP Entrepreneur, or Woke Capitalist.
    Each of these compound nouns has within it a fusion of a once-left-associated
    concept and a right-associated one. That prefix is important: once-left-associated.
    At one point, Christians led a revolutionary movement against the Roman Empire,
    Protestants led a decentralist movement against the Catholic Church, Republicans
    led an abolitionist movement against the South, the Soviets led an internationalist
    movement against the nationalist White Russians, the CCP led a communist movement
    against the capitalists, and the Wokes led a critical movement against American
    institutions. But then they gained power, and with power came new habits. The
    revolutionary left that justified the rise to power morphed partially into an
    institutional right that justified the use of power. By its nature, a revolutionary
    group adopts leftist tactics to gain power, but once it wins, finds it needs to
    use rightist tactics to maintain power against a new crop of leftist insurgents.'

    an acquisition, or the writer who just refuses to hold back a story because of
    his editor’s political demurrals. Born revolutionaries of this stripe include
    Glenn Greenwald, Matt Taibbi, Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, and many Substackers and
    tech founders. They just can’t bend to the establishment. But they also have real
    disagreements with each other, which is why they’re independents, and why they
    can’t mouth a party line. So the born revolutionary is really far more anti-establishment,
    and hence today anti-Democrat, than pro-Republican. Many of the most accomplished
    in tech and media share this characteristic – they don’t want to listen to authority
    because they think they know better, and in their case they often actually do.
    They’re fundamentally insubordinate and disobedient, rule breakers and novelty
    seekers, ideological rather than tribal, founders rather than followers — and
    thus sand in the gears of any establishment.

    of robotics. That is, for things we can do completely on the computer, productivity
    has measurably accelerated. It is 100X faster to email something than to mail
    it. But a slow human still needs to act on it. So, in this hypothesis, humans
    are now the limiting factor. Essentially, representing a complex project on disk
    in something like Google Docs may not be the productivity win we think it is.
    Humans still need to comprehend all those electronic documents to build the thing
    in real life. So the problem may be in the analog/digital interface. Do we need
    to actuate as fast as we compute? That would mean zero-delay robotic task completion
    will be the true productivity unlock. And that we haven’t gone full digital yet.
    So long as humans are still in the loop, we won’t get the full benefits of digital

- text: Understanding the term “nation state” requires us to distinguish the nation
    (a group of people with common descent, history, culture, or language) from the
    state (their government). They are not the same. Even though “nation” is often
    conflated with “state,” the term “nation state” has two words for a reason. The
    first word (nation) has the same etymological root as “natality.” It once denoted
    a group of people with shared ancestry. The second word (state) refers to the
    entity that governs these people, that commands the police and the military, and
    that holds the monopoly of violence over the geographic area that the nation inhabits.
    In a sense, the nation and the state are as different as labor and management
    in a factory. The former are the masses and the latter are the elite.
  page: Page 327
- text: In theory, the state was meant to be an innovation in violence reduction.
    You stay in your lane, I stay in mine. Clear sovereigns would keep domestic order,
    and the principle of national sovereignty would deter aggression from abroad.
    It didn’t entirely work out like that, of course; both intrastate and interstate
    conflict still occurred. But the abstraction of nation states may still have been
    preferable to the preceding era of fuzzy bordered empires and conflicting sovereigns.

    any other man, even if the shooter was old and frail and the shootee was Sir Lancelot

    centralized and have limited scale. So particularist city states populated by
    small ethnic groups get rolled up by universalist nation states (or empires) with
    many ethnic groups.161 That’s the reason a network state has a virtual capital
    rather than a physical one. Think of it as “remote-first,” but for a society.
    In a remote company, nothing officially exists unless it’s online, in an internal
    system of record like GitHub. Similarly, in a remote society, nothing officially
    exists unless it’s on-chain, in the blockchain system of record for that society.
    Put another way: if you don’t consciously set the capital of your network state
    to be virtual, it’ll be physical. And if it’s physical, the capital is centralized
    in one place, and can get invaded by a nation state. But if it’s instead a virtual
    capital, with a backend that is encrypted and on-chain, then - in the fullness
    of time - you can host an entire subset of the metaverse there, assuming blockspace
    increases as bandwidth did.'

    but that bears repeating, is that the network state system assumes the world has
    flipped to digital first: all nontrivial human-created events start in the cloud

    there are still physical plots of land, there are still physical rivers and mountains.
    And for some law enforcement and military functions a network state will need
    physical robots. But in a network state, everything physical is downstream of
    lines of code and enforced by cryptography, just as in a nation state, everything
    physical is downstream of pieces of paper and enforced by the police and military.

- text: So, the network state system assumes that states like the USA and PRC will
    continue centralizing the power of their tech companies into one all-seeing dashboard,
    capable of surveilling, deplatforming, freezing, and sanctioning millions at once,
    or anyone at will. This digital power is currently exercised transnationally and
    without the consent of the governed. They have no true free choice of administrator.
    The network state system assumes that we can’t fully put this genie back in the
    bottle, but we can constrain it. Specifically, we grant that every legitimate
    state will need such power to govern its subnetwork, for the same reason any centralized
    service needs a system administrator with root access. But we also build decentralized
    services that do not have any single system administrator, and tools for the physical
    and digital exit of citizens.

    Similarly, if we had a free region of the cloud, we could have a network without

    a cloud without corporations. He showed us how to create digital networks without
    any single centralized authority. One extension of that gives us decentralized
    social networks, the basis for an open metaverse. So that’s one way to solve the
    problem: build digital land that isn’t controlled by any single startup. Anyone
    on that land could then freely choose between governance networks.'

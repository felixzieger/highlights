    gave me is something that has fascinated me for almost as long as I can remember

    been able to do – for long periods under reduced and balanced canvas, long enough
    for him to get sufficient sleep before she gybed and threw him out of his bunk
    below. The boat had always possessed these abilities, but it had required necessity
    and the abandonment of other methods to discover them. This is what sailors have
    always done as long as they have gone to sea in boats, and it is only the recent
    invention of efficient self-steering systems that has brought about the widespread
    atrophy of this skill in modern sailors.

    to gain, always for him a sign of a sympathetic environment. His unceasing close
    communion with the three constant physical elements of his world – his boat, the
    sea, and the weather around him – filled him with joy. And to complete the picture
    of happy asceticism, his hair and beard had grown long and matted until he resembled
    a sailing holy man.

    have also failed, come undone, broken, chafed through, and sent people to their
    deaths. An overreliance on them breeds an atrophy of the best of all devices to
    keep a sailor aboard: a fully developed horror of going overboard.'

    height of a storm, are always later disappointing in their inability to convey
    what such a scene ‘felt like’. Ironically, the impossible and wholly unrealistic
    computer-generated waves and conditions depicted in a film like The Perfect Storm
    do in fact provide very accurate impressions of what it looks like far out at
    sea in a terrible storm. It is their excessive exaggeration that mirrors the subjective
    impression of the human observer. Yet the movie feels safe. It comes without the
    horrifying realisation that this is real, there’s no way out, nothing in all the
    world will save you now but luck

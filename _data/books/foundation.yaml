    Hardin leaped through the opening. “Are you, though? That’s a nice hallucination,
    isn’t it? Your bunch here is a perfect example of what’s been wrong with the entire
    Galaxy for thousands of years. What kind of science is it to be stuck out here
    for centuries classifying the work of scientists of the last millennium? Have
    you ever thought of working onward, extending their knowledge and improving upon
    it? No! You’re quite happy to stagnate. The whole Galaxy is, and has been for
    space knows how long. That’s why the Periphery is revolting; that’s why communications
    are breaking down; that’s why petty wars are becoming eternal; that’s why whole
    systems are losing nuclear power and going back to barbarous techniques of chemical
    power. “If you ask me,” he cried, “the Galactic Empire is dying!”

    is a little sprinkling of common sense.” “For instance?” “For instance, if he
    foresaw the Anacreonian mess, why not have placed us on some other planet nearer
    the Galactic centers? It’s well known that Seldon maneuvered the Commissioners
    on Trantor into ordering the Foundation established on Terminus. But why should
    he have done so? Why put us out here at all if he could see in advance the break
    in communication lines, our isolation from the Galaxy, the threat of our neighbors—and
    our helplessness because of the lack of metals on Terminus? That above all! Or
    if he foresaw all this, why not have warned the original settlers in advance that
    they might have had time to prepare, rather than wait, as he is doing, until one
    foot is over the cliff, before doing so? “And don’t forget this. Even though he
    could foresee the problem then, we can see it equally well now. Therefore, if
    he could foresee the solution then, we should be able to see it now. After all,
    Seldon was not a magician. There are no trick methods of escaping from a dilemma
    that he can see and we can’t.” “But, Hardin,” reminded Fara, “we can’t!” “But
    you haven’t tried. You haven’t tried once. First, you refused to admit that there
    was a menace at all! Then you reposed an absolutely blind faith in the Emperor!
    Now you’ve shifted it to Hari Seldon. Throughout you have invariably relied on

    of discussion, what are your terms? What do you require to exchange your ideas
    for mine?” “You think my convictions are for sale?” “Why not?” came the cold response.
    “Isn’t that your business, buying and selling?” “Only at a profit,” said Mallow,
    unoffended. “Can you offer me more than I’m getting as is?”

    more and more venerable, traditional—and immovable. In some ways, it isn’t under
    our control any more.” “In what ways?” demanded Mallow. “Don’t stop. I want your
    thoughts.” “Well, suppose one man, one ambitious man, uses the force of religion
    against us, rather than for us.” “You mean Sutt—” “You’re right. I mean Sutt.
    Listen, man, if he could mobilize the various hierarchies on the subject planets
    against the Foundation in the name of orthodoxy, what chance would we stand?

    Hardin quotation of yours, it’s a poor nuclear blaster that won’t point both ways.
    If Korell prospered with our trade, so did we. If Korellian factories fail without
    our trade; and if the prosperity of the outer worlds vanishes with commercial
    isolation; so will our factories fail and our prosperity vanish. “And there isn’t
    a factory, not a trading center, not a shipping line that isn’t under my control;
    that I couldn’t squeeze to nothing if Sutt attempts revolutionary propaganda.

    a land of traders and merchant princes. Then what of the future?” Mallow lifted
    his gloomy face, and exclaimed fiercely, “What business of mine is the future?
    No doubt Seldon has foreseen it and prepared against it. There will be other crises
    in the time to come when money power has become as dead a force as religion is
    now. Let my successors solve those new problems, as I have solved the one of today.”

- text: Seriousness always has to do with an established script, an ordering of affairs
    completed somewhere outside the range of our influence. We are playful when we

    simply the point beyond which we cannot see. There is nothing in the horizon itself,
    however, that limits vision, for the horizon opens onto all that lies beyond itself.
    What limits vision is rather the incompleteness of that vision. One never reaches
    a horizon. It is not a line; it has no place; it encloses no field; its location
    is always relative to the view. To move toward a horizon is simply to have a new
    horizon. One can therefore never be close to one’s horizon, though one may certainly
    have a short range of vision, a narrow horizon.

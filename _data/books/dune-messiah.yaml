    She shook her head. “That’s… that’s…” “A bitter pill,” he said, watching the guards
    run toward them across the roof, taking up their escort positions. “Bitter nonsense!”
    “The greatest palatinate earl and the lowliest stipendiary serf share the same

    That is the substance of my command. There are to be no balance-of-payment difficulties
    between the different spheres of influence. And the reason for this is simply
    because I command it. I want to emphasize my authority in this area. I am the

    he felt mud clinging to the shoes of his childhood. Then he was back in the sand,
    in the dust-clotted, wind-muffled darkness with the Future hanging over him, taunting.
    He could feel the aridity of life around him like an accusation. You did this!
    They’d become a civilization of dry-eyed watchers and tale-tellers, people who
    solved all problems with power… and more power… and still more power—hating every
    erg of it.

    from ourselves the violence we intend toward each other. Between depriving a man
    of one hour from his life and depriving him of his life there exists only a difference
    of degree. You have done violence to him, consumed his energy. Elaborate euphemisms

    your love…” But his mood had changed. “You can’t build politics on love,” he said.
    “People aren’t concerned with love; it’s too disordered. They prefer despotism.
    Too much freedom breeds chaos. We can’t have that, can we? And how do you make
    despotism lovable?” “You’re not a despot!” she protested, tying her scarf. “Your
    laws are just.” “Ahh, laws,” he said. He crossed to the window, pulled back the
    draperies as though he could look out. “What’s law? Control? Law filters chaos
    and what drips through? Serenity? Law—our highest ideal and our basest nature.
    Don’t look too closely at the law. Do, and you’ll find the rationalized interpretations,
    the legal casuistry, the precedents of convenience. You’ll find the serenity,
    which is just another word for death.”'

    her guard amazons waited. “You produce a deadly paradox,” Jessica had written.
    “Government cannot be religious and self-assertive at the same time. Religious
    experience needs a spontaneity which laws inevitably suppress. And you cannot
    govern without laws. Your laws eventually must replace morality, replace conscience,
    replace even the religion by which you think to govern. Sacred ritual must spring
    from praise and holy yearnings which hammer out a significant morality. Government,
    on the other hand, is a cultural organism particularly attractive to doubts, questions

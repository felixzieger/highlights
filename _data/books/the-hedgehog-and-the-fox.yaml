- text: Tolstoy stood at the opposite pole to all this. He believed that only by patient
    empirical observation could any knowledge be obtained; that this knowledge is
    always inadequate, that simple people often know the truth better than learned
    men, because their observation of men and nature is less clouded by empty theories,
    and not because they are inspired vehicles of the divine afflatus.

- text: Consequently the fuller our knowledge of facts and of their connections the
    more difficult to conceive alternatives; the clearer and more exact the terms
    – or categories – in which we conceive and describe the world, the more fixed
    our world structure, the less ‘free’ acts seem. To know these limits, both of
    imagination and, ultimately, of thought itself, is to come face to face with the
    ‘inexorable’ unifying pattern of the world; to realise our identity with it, to
    submit to it, is to find truth and peace. This is not mere oriental fatalism,
    nor the mechanistic determinism of the celebrated German materialists of the day,
    Büchner and Vogt, or Moleschott, admired so deeply by the revolutionary ‘nihilists’
    of Tolstoy’s generation in Russia; nor is it a yearning for mystical illumination
    or integration. It is scrupulously empirical, rational, tough-minded and realistic.
    But its emotional cause is a passionate desire for a monistic vision of life on
    the part of a fox bitterly intent upon seeing in the manner of a hedgehog.

- text: 'Opposed as Tolstoy and Maistre were – one the apostle of the gospel that
    all men are brothers, the other the cold defender of the claims of violence, blind
    sacrifice, and eternal suffering – they were united by inability to escape from
    the same tragic paradox: they were both by nature sharp-eyed foxes, inescapably
    aware of sheer, de facto differences which divide and forces which disrupt the
    human world, observers utterly incapable of being deceived by the many subtle
    devices, the unifying systems and faiths and sciences, by which the superficial
    or the desperate sought to conceal the chaos from themselves and from one another.
    Both looked for a harmonious universe, but everywhere found war and disorder,
    which no attempt to cheat, however heavily disguised, could even begin to hide;
    and so, in a condition of final despair, offered to throw away the terrible weapons
    of criticism with which both, but particularly Tolstoy, were over-generously endowed,
    in favour of the single great vision, something too indivisibly simple and remote
    from normal intellectual processes to be assailable by the instruments of reason,
    and therefore, perhaps, offering a path to peace and salvation.'

- text: I think that you truly
    believe that I prefer foxes to hedgehogs, but this is not so. No greater poet
    than Dante, no greater philosopher than Plato, no profounder novelist than Dostoevsky
    exists; yet, of course, they seem to me to have been hedgehogs, and although I
    do think that they were fanatical unitarians – and that this can lead to disastrous
    consequences in social, personal and political life – this is the price that may
    be paid for forms of genius which may well be profounder than any other. I may
    have more personal sympathy with foxes; I may think that they are politically
    more enlightened, tolerant and humane; but this does not imply they are otherwise
    more valuable – if such comparisons of incommensurables make sense at all.

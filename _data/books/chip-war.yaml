    rise and America’s fall. Some analysts saw evidence of a broader manufacturing
    decay that started in steel, then afflicted cars, and was now spreading to high-tech
    industries. In 1987, Nobel Prize−winning MIT economist Robert Solow, who pioneered
    the study of productivity and economic growth, argued that the chip industry suffered
    from an “unstable structure,” with employees job hopping between firms and companies
    declining to invest in their workers. Prominent economist Robert Reich lamented
    the “paper entrepreneurialism” in Silicon Valley, which he thought focused too
    much on the search for prestige and affluence rather than technical advances.

    the Soviets faced a continued technological lag. In 1985, the CIA conducted a
    study of Soviet microprocessors and found that the USSR produced replicas of Intel
    and Motorola chips like clockwork. They were always half a decade behind.

- text: As Bill Perry watched the Persian Gulf War unfold, he knew laser-guided bombs
    were just one of dozens of military systems that had been revolutionized by integrated
    circuits, enabling better surveillance, communication, and computing power. The
    Persian Gulf War was the first major test of Perry’s “offset strategy,” which
    had been devised after the Vietnam War but never deployed in a sizeable battle.
    In the years after Vietnam, the U.S. military had talked about its new capabilities,
    but many people didn’t take them seriously. Military leaders like General William
    Westmoreland, who commanded American forces in Vietnam, promised that future battlefields
    would be automated. But the Vietnam War had gone disastrously despite America’s
    wide technological advantage over the North Vietnamese.

    as out of touch as his macho swagger. The new class of CEOs who took over America’s
    semiconductor firms in the 2000s and 2010s tended to speak the language of MBAs
    as well as PhDs, chatting casually about capex and margins with Wall Street analysts
    on quarterly earnings calls. By most measures this new generation of executive
    talent was far more professional than the chemists and physicists who’d built
    Silicon Valley. But they often seemed stale in comparison to the giants who preceded
    them. An era of wild wagers on impossible technologies was being superseded by
    something more organized, professionalized, and rationalized. Bet-the-house gambles
    were replaced by calculated risk management. It was hard to escape the sense that
    something was lost in the process.

- text: Since his earliest days at Apple, Steve Jobs had thought deeply about the
    relationship between software and hardware. In 1980, when his hair nearly reached
    his shoulders and his mustache covered his upper lip, Jobs gave a lecture that
    asked, “What is software?” “The only thing I can think of,” he answered, “is software
    is something that is changing too rapidly, or you don’t exactly know what you
    want yet, or you didn’t have time to get it into hardware.”

    I do not want to understate the importance of recorded, non-explanatory information.
    This is of course essential to everything from the reproduction of a micro-organism
    (which has such information in its DNA molecules) to the most abstract human thinking.
    So what distinguishes understanding from mere  {10}  knowing?

    resolves itself into a measure of simplicity and comprehensibility. This is called

    a critique of the celestial-sphere theory and some additional observations, just
    as there is no simple way of designing the DNA of a koala bear, given the properties
    of eucalyptus trees. Evolution, or trial and error - especially the focused, purposeful
    form of trial and error called scientific discovery - are the only ways. For this
    reason, Popper has called his theory that knowledge can grow only by conjecture
    and refutation, in the manner of Figure 3.3, an evolutionary epistemology.

    is no path to understanding.'

    This open accessibility, not only of evidence but of the whole mechanism of knowledge
    acquisition, is a key attribute of Galileo's conception of reality.

    and independent of what we believe about it. But we never experience that reality
    directly. Every last scrap of our external experience is of virtual reality. And
    every last scrap of our knowledge - including our knowledge of the non-physical
    worlds of logic, mathematics and philosophy, and of imagination, fiction, art
    and fantasy - is encoded in the form of programs for the rendering of those worlds
    on our brain''s own virtual-reality generator.'

    First, it is to kick the rendered environment and to be kicked back in return
    - in other words, to interact with the environment in an autonomous way. In the
    biological case, that role is performed by the external habitat. Second, it is
    to provide the intention behind the rendering. That is to say, it makes little
    sense to speak of a particular situation as being a virtual-reality rendering
    if there is no concept of the rendering being accurate or inaccurate. I have said
    that the accuracy of a rendering is the closeness, as perceived by the user, of
    the rendered environment to the intended one.

    pressure, on convection and nucleosynthesis. It does not depend at all on the
    geology of Venus, the chemistry of Jupiter, or the pattern of craters on the Moon.
    But it does depend on what happens to intelligent life on the planet Earth. It
    depends on politics and economics and the outcomes of wars. It depends on what
     {184}  people do: what decisions they make, what problems they solve, what values
    they adopt, and on how they behave towards their children.'

    than other physical processes, but by being more knowledgeable. In terms of its
    gross effect on the outcomes of physical processes, knowledge is at least as significant
    as any other physical quantity.

- text: Now consider some mathematical calculation that is intractable on all classical
    computers, but suppose that a quantum computer can easily perform it using interference
    between, say, 10500 universes. To make the point more clearly, let the calculation
    be such that the answer (unlike the result of a factorization) cannot be tractably
    verified once we have it. The process of programming a quantum computer to perform
    such a computation, running the program and obtaining a result, constitutes a
    proof that the mathematical calculation has that particular result. But now there
    is no way of keeping a record of everything that happened during the proof process,
    because most of it happened in other universes, and measuring the computational
    state would alter the interference properties and so invalidate the proof. So
    creating an old-fashioned proof object would be infeasible; moreover, there is
    not remotely enough material in the universe as we know it to make such an object,
    since there would be vastly more steps in the proof than there are atoms in the
    known universe. This example shows that because of the possibility of quantum
    computation, the two notions of proof are not equivalent.

    mistaken. Real, quantum-mechanical paper is wildly different from the abstract
    stuff that the Turing machine uses. The Turing machine is entirely classical,
    and does not allow for the possibility that the paper might have different symbols
    written on it in different universes, and that those might interfere with one
    another. Of course, it is impractical to detect interference between different
    states of a paper tape. But the point is that Turing’s intuition, because it included
    false assumptions from classical physics, caused him to abstract away some of
    the computational properties of his hypothetical machine, the very properties
    he intended to keep. That is why

    come from the future of that copy of Shakespeare. He can affect, or perhaps replace,
    the copy he visits. But he can never visit the copy who existed in the universe
    he started from. And it is that copy who wrote the plays. So the plays had a genuine
    author, and there are no paradoxical loops of the kind envisaged in the story.
    Knowledge and adaptation are, even in the presence of pathways to the past, brought
    into existence only incrementally, by acts of human creativity or biological evolution,

    the explanation might be that the world is comprehensible. Such an explanation
    can, and in fact does, fit in with other explanations in other fields. But the
    theory that the world is half-comprehensible explains nothing and could not possibly
    fit in with explanations in other fields unless they explained it. It simply restates
    the problem and introduces an unexplained constant, one-half.

    For example, we believe that the predictions of the theory of evolution follow
    logically from the laws of physics, even though proving the connection might be
    computationally intractable. But the explanations in the theory of evolution are
    not believed to follow from physics at all. However, a non-hierarchical explanatory
    structure allows for the possibility of explanatory emergence.

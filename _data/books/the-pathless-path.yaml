- text: If there are clear boundaries to behavior within a given field of endeavor,
    then there is also great freedom to adapt and imagine within those lines. These
    boundaries, however, should always be tested to see if they are actually still
    real. It takes conscious acts by individuals to test these edges. – David Whyte

    If you had told me when I was building that spreadsheet of dream jobs during college
    that not only would I work for several of those companies, but also directly with
    some of the most famous CEOs in the world, I would have been shocked. But I also
    would have thought that was exactly what I wanted. As I sat there, I didn’t know
    how to want it anymore.

    building’s outside walls. Decades after the offices had been built, their positions
    and sizes were still clear markers of importance. My small office was a step up
    from the cubicles, but I was still years away from having a real office. I always
    appreciated the clarity of these distinctions. So many companies seem afraid to
    make these power dynamics visible, disguising them behind open offices and casual
    dress codes.

    Your Life offer a helpful reframe, calling these issues “gravity problems” which
    are part of life “…but, like gravity, it’s not a problem that can be solved.”

    need to find, and finding it is a matter of getting lost.

    advice, arguing that societies need people to embrace their individuality and
    perform “experiments in living.” He argued that such experiments are vital to
    the pursuit of knowledge and that cultures only learn and evolve when original
    approaches to living are discovered. Mill wanted people to act on their inspiration
    because “the worth of different modes of life should be proved practically when
    anyone thinks fit to try them.”91 By choosing a unique and personal fixed point,
    in Mill’s view, you are not only raising the odds of finding a path worth staying
    on, but you are also serving an important role in pushing culture forward.

    You waste years by not being able to waste hours. — Amos Tversky

- text: 'Many people I talk to are convinced that the formula for living on their
    own terms is saving up enough money. I wish they knew what I know: the longer
    we spend on a path that isn’t ours, the longer it takes to move towards a path
    that is. Money might help pay for therapy, time off, and healing retreats, but
    it won’t help you come to a place where you really trust and know that everything
    will be okay.'

- text: Yet this is the world we live in. This means embracing the pathless path requires
    grappling with the feeling of being a “bad egg.” This often drives people who
    leave the default path to eagerly embrace new identities that are still recognizable
    as legible to the “traditional” economy. They gravitate to titles like a startup
    founder, entrepreneur, freelance consultant, or even the newly emerging “creator.”

    a company he wanted to keep working at and all his decisions continue to be based
    on this goal. As his platform grew, corporations started asking the company to
    do customized installations for them. John decided he didn’t want to deal with
    these high‑maintenance customers and turned them down. Despite this obvious opportunity,
    Ghost still does not employ a single employee that works with enterprise customers.
    John learned the same lesson I had in taking the client that had drained my energy.
    No money is worth it if it undermines your desire to stay on the journey.

    or achieve any other metric. It’s to actively and consciously search for the work
    that you want to keep doing.

    really going on when we struggle to pay attention to our intuitions and desires.
    She defines shame as “the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing
    that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging.” She believes
    that most people give too much power to this emotion when making life choices.”

- text: Over the last 100 years, the number of ways you can engage with life has exploded
    beyond imagination. Now, not only political leaders offer narratives for interacting
    with the world, but also employers, companies, media outlets, and other institutions.
    Everyone gives you roadmaps for living life and becoming free. You just have to
    buy their products, embrace their story, or join their company, and instead of
    having to develop your own agency, the respective institution will make you part
    of their special group.

- text: 'Ultimately, figuring out what to do with freedom once we have it is one of
    the biggest challenges of the pathless path. Writer Simon Sarris argues that we
    can only do this by increasing our capacity for agency, or our ability to take
    deliberate action in the world. He argues, “the secret of the world is that it
    is a very malleable place, we must be sure that people learn this, and never forget
    the order: Learning is naturally the consequence of doing.”158 In other words,
    only by taking action do we learn and only by learning do we discover what we
    want. Without this, we will struggle to take advantage of the freedom that the
    pathless path offers.'

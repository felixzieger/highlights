    ambitious—for himself. He is completely trustworthy—out of no loyalty but to himself.
    He knows that it is on my coattails that he rides and he would do anything to
    increase my power that the ride might be long and far and that the destination
    might be glorious. If he goes with you, there is just that added

    untouched and unmolded except by the manifold disorganizations of the universe.
    It writhed in floods and waves. There was caution on the surface, a thin, smoothing
    effect, but with touches of cynical ribaldry in the hidden eddies of it. And underneath
    there was the strong flow of self-interest and self-love, with a gush of cruel
    humor here and there, and a deep, still pool of ambition underlying all.

    who knew better than he that even those laws were relative? He never created a

    young man whirled on him savagely. “Then you’re a fat fool. What do you expect

    in tight beams spell out ‘Second Foundation’ in green and purple along the incoming
    spaceship routes? Listen to me, Turbor. Wherever they are, they form a tight oligarchy.
    They must be as well hidden on the world on which they exist, as the world itself
    is in the Galaxy as a whole.” Turbor’s jaw muscles writhed. “I don’t like your
    attitude, Anthor.” “That certainly disturbs me,” was the sarcastic response. “Take
    a look about you here on Terminus. We’re at the center—the core—the origin of
    the First Foundation with all its knowledge of physical science. Well, how many
    of the population are physical scientists? Can you operate an Energy Transmitting
    Station? What do you know of the operation of a hypernuclear motor? Eh? The number
    of real scientists on Terminus—even on Terminus—can be numbered at less than one

    against us. That, at least, is not as it was before.” “A good point. But they
    have no one to use it against. It has become a sterile device; just as without
    the spur of our own menace against them, encephalographic analysis will become
    a sterile science. Other varieties of knowledge will once again bring more important
    and immediate returns. So this first generation of mental scientists among the
    First Foundation will also be the last—and, in a century, Mind

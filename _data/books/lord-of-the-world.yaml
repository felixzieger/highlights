    What can I say? But I don’t think I’ve ever seen any one die.” “Nor have I till
    to-day,” said the girl, and shivered a little. “The euthanasia people were soon
    at work.” Oliver took her hand gently. “My darling, it must have been frightful.
    Why, you’re trembling still.” “No; but listen.… You know, if I had had anything
    to say I could have said it too. They were all just in front of me: I wondered;
    then I knew I hadn’t. I couldn’t possibly have talked about Humanity.”'

    seemed so hopeless and ineffective. He tried not to reflect on his fellow-priests,
    but for the fiftieth time he could not help seeing that they were not the men
    for the present situation. It was not that he preferred himself; he knew perfectly
    well that he, too, was fully as incompetent: had he not proved to be so with poor
    Father Francis, and scores of others who had clutched at him in their agony during
    the last ten years? Even the Archbishop, holy man as he was, with all his childlike
    faith—was that the man to lead English Catholics and confound their enemies? There
    seemed no giants on the earth in these days. What in the world was to be done?
    He buried his face in his hands.… Yes; what was wanted was a new Order in the
    Church; the old ones were rule-bound through no fault of their own.'

    to history. It seems from his words that Mr. FELSENBURGH (whose biography, so
    far as it is known, we give in another column) is probably the greatest orator
    that the world has ever known—we use these words deliberately. All languages seem
    the same to him; he delivered speeches during the eight months through which the
    Eastern Convention lasted, in no

    Her heart had yearned for some such thing as this—some public corporate profession
    of what all now believed. She had so resented the dulness of folk who were content
    with action and never considered its springs. Surely this instinct within her
    was a true one; she desired to stand with her fellows in some solemn place, consecrated
    not by priests but by the will of man; to have as her inspirers sweet singing
    and the peal of organs; to utter her sorrow with thousands beside her at her own
    feebleness of immolation before the Spirit of all; to sing aloud her praise of
    the glory of life, and to offer by sacrifice and incense an emblematic homage
    to That from which she drew her being, and to whom one day she must render it
    again. Ah! these Christians had understood human nature, she had told herself
    a hundred times: it was true that they had degraded it, darkened light, poisoned
    thought, misinterpreted instinct; but they had understood that man must worship—must
    worship or sink.'

    took a paper, passed on into his inner room, and sat down. There it all was—gigantic
    headlines, and four columns of print broken by startling title phrases in capital
    letters, after the fashion set by America a hundred years ago. No better way even
    yet had been found of misinforming the unintelligent.

    neither the ecstasies nor the desolations of his master. It was an immense and
    solemn joy to him to live here at the spot of God’s Incarnation and in attendance
    upon His Vicar. As regarded the movements of the world, he observed them as a
    man in a ship watches the heaving of the waves far beneath. Of course the world
    was restless, he half perceived,

    “Oh! West undoubtedly. The East thinks a good deal, but it doesn’t act much. And

    she was. She even spoke Oliver’s name aloud, staring round the unfamiliar room,
    wondering what she did here. Then she remembered, and was silent.… It was the
    eighth day she had spent in this Home; her probation was finished: to-day she
    was at liberty to do that for which she had come. On the Saturday of the previous
    week she had gone through her private examination before the magistrate, stating
    under the usual conditions of secrecy her name, age and home, as well as her reasons
    for making the application for Euthanasia; and all had passed off well. She had
    selected Manchester as being sufficiently remote and sufficiently large to secure
    her freedom from Oliver’s molestation; and her secret had been admirably kept.
    There was not a hint that her husband knew anything of her intentions; for, after
    all, in these cases the police were bound to assist the fugitive. Individualism
    was at least so far recognised as to secure to those weary of life the right of
    relinquishing it. She scarcely knew why she had selected this method, except that
    any other seemed impossible. The knife required skill and resolution; firearms
    were unthinkable, and poison, under the new stringent regulations, was hard to
    obtain. Besides, she seriously wished to test her own intentions, and to be quite
    sure that there was no other way than this.… Well, she was as certain as ever.
    The thought had first come to her in the mad misery of the outbreak of violence
    on the last day of the old year. Then it had gone again, soothed away by the arguments
    that man was still liable to relapse. Then once more it had recurred, a cold and
    convincing phantom, in the plain daylight revealed by Felsenburgh’s Declaration.
    It had taken up its abode with her then, yet she controlled it, hoping against
    hope that the Declaration would not be carried into action, occasionally revolting
    against its horror. Yet it had never been far away; and finally when the policy
    sprouted into deliberate law, she had yielded herself resolutely to its suggestion.
    That was eight days ago; and she had not had one moment of faltering since that.
    Yet she had ceased to condemn. The logic had silenced her. All that she knew was
    that she could not bear it; that she had misconceived the New Faith; that for
    her, whatever it was for others, there was no hope.… She had not even a child
    of her own. Those eight days, required by law, had passed very peacefully. She
    had taken with her enough money to enter one of the private homes furnished with
    sufficient comfort to save from distractions those who had been accustomed to
    gentle living: the nurses had been pleasant and sympathetic; she had nothing to
    complain of. She had suffered, of course, to some degree from reactions. The second
    night after her arrival had been terrible, when as she lay in bed in the hot darkness,
    her whole sentient life had protested and struggled against the fate her will
    ordained. It had demanded the familiar things—the promise of food and breath and
    human intercourse; it had writhed in horror against the blind dark towards which
    it moved so inevitably; and, in the agony had been pacified only by the half-hinted
    promise of some deeper voice suggesting that death was not the end. With morning
    light sanity had come back; the will had reassumed the mastery, and, with it,
    had withdrawn explicitly the implied hope of continued existence.'

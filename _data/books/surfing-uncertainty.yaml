    and help bring about the play of sensory stimulation, we may be glimpsing some
    of the core functionality that allows three pounds or so of mobile, body-based
    brain-meat, immersed in the human social and environmental swirl, to know and
    engage its world.

    learning is to see it as offering an innocent (that is, ecologically feasible)
    form of supervised learning. More accurately, it offers a form of self-supervised
    learning, in which the ‘correct’ response is repeatedly provided, in a kind of
    ongoing rolling fashion, by the environment itself.

- text: 'predictive forms of learning are particularly compelling because they provide
    a ubiquitous source of learning signals: if you attempt to predict everything
    that happens next, then every single moment is a learning opportunity. This kind
    of pervasive learning can for example explain how an infant seems to magically
    acquire such a sophisticated understanding of the world,'

- text: The prediction task, thus conceived, is a kind of bootstrap heaven. For example,
    to predict the next word in a sentence, it helps to know about grammar (and lots
    more too). But one way to learn a surprising amount about grammar (and lots more
    too) is to look for the best ways to predict the next words in sentences. This
    is just the kind of training that the world can naturally provide, since your
    attempts at prediction are soon followed by the soundform corresponding to (you
    guessed it) the next word in the sentence. You can thus use the prediction task
    to bootstrap your way to the grammar, which you then use in the prediction task
    in future.

- text: prediction-driven learning, as it unfolds in these kinds of multilayer settings,
    tends to separate out interacting distal (or bodily) causes operating at varying
    scales of space and time. This is important since structured domains are ubiquitous
    in both the natural and human-built world. Language exhibits densely nested compositional
    structure in which words form clauses that form whole sentences that are themselves
    understood by locating them in the context of even larger linguistic (and non-linguistic)
    settings. Every visual scene, such as a city street, a factory floor, or a tranquil
    lake, embeds multiple nested structures (e.g., shops, shop doorways, shoppers
    in the doorways; trees, branches, birds on the branches, leaves, patterns on the
    leaves). Musical pieces exhibit structures in which overarching sequences are
    built from recurring and recombinant sub-sequences, each of which has structure
    of its own. The world, we might reasonably suggest, is known by us humans (and
    doubtless most other animals too) as a meaningful arena populated by articulated
    and nested structures of elements.

    that ‘our results support an account of perception as a process of probabilistic
    inference … wherein integration of top-down and bottom-up information takes place
    at every level of the cortical hierarchy’

- text: An interesting upshot of this is that many visual illusions, as mentioned
    in 1.12, may nonetheless be best understood as ‘optimal percepts’. In other words,
    given the structure and statistics of the world we inhabit, the optimal estimate
    of the worldly state (the estimate that represents the best possible take on the
    incoming signal, given what the system already knows) will be the one that, on
    some occasions, gets things wrong. A few local failures, then, are just the price
    we pay for being able to get things right, most of the time, in a world cloaked
    by ambiguity and noise.

- text: The largest contributor to ongoing neural response is the ceaseless anticipatory
    buzz of downwards-flowing neural prediction that drives perception and action
    in a circular causal flow. Incoming sensory information is just one further factor
    perturbing those restless pro-active seas. As ever-active prediction engines these
    kinds of brains are not, fundamentally, in the business of ‘processing inputs’
    at all. Rather, they are in the business of predicting their inputs. This pro-active
    neural strategy keeps us poised for action and (as we shall later see) allows
    mobile, embodied agents to intervene on the world, bringing about the kinds of
    sensory flow that keep them viable and fulfilled.

- text: The perceptual problems that confront us in daily life vary greatly in the
    demands they make upon us. For many tasks, it is best to deploy large amounts
    of prior knowledge, using that knowledge to drive complex proactive patterns of
    gaze fixation, while for others it may be better to sit back and let the world
    do as much of the driving as possible. Which strategy (more heavily input-driven
    or more heavily expectation-driven) is best is also hostage to a multitude of
    contextual effects. Driving along a very familiar road in heavy fog, it can sometimes
    be wise to let detailed top-down knowledge play a substantial role. Driving fast
    along an unfamiliar winding mountain road, we need to let sensory input take the
    lead

    sensory uncertainty. Within the PP framework, these estimations of sensory uncertainty
    modify the impact of sensory prediction error. This, in essence, is the predictive
    processing model of attention. Attention, thus construed, is a means of variably
    balancing the potent interactions between top-down and bottom-up influences by
    factoring in their so-called ‘precision’, where this is a measure of their estimated
    certainty or reliability (inverse variance, for the statistically savvy). This
    is achieved by altering the weighting (the gain or ‘volume’, to

- text: Indeed, it seems very likely that for most creatures acts of deliberate imagining
    (which I suspect may require the use of self-cueing via language) are simply impossible.
    But creatures that are thus enabled to perceive a structured world possess the
    neural resources to generate, from the top-down, approximations to those same
    sensory states. There thus emerges a deep duality between online perception (as
    enabled by the predictive processing architecture) and capacities for the endogenous
    generation of quasi-sensory states.

- text: In the absence of the driving sensory signal, there is no stable ongoing information
    (in the form of reliable, estimated-as-high-precision, prediction error) about
    low-level perceptual detail available to constrain the system, and hence no pressure
    to create or maintain a stable hypothesis at the lower levels of processing.

- text: The bulk of our story so far has focused upon the use of stored knowledge
    to predict what might be thought of as a kind of ‘rolling present’. Obviously,
    these processes of prediction depend heavily upon past experiences. But that dependence
    does not (yet) involve the actual recollection of past experiences. Instead, the
    past there exists only as it is crystallized into the agent-inaccessible form
    of altered probability density distributions used to meet and to organize the
    incoming sensory flow.

    to use information from the past and the present to generate predictions about
    the future’ (Schacter et al., 2007, p. 660). This may be the deep reason why episodic
    memory is fragile, patchy, and reconstructive since ‘a memory system that simply
    stored rote records would not be well-suited to simulating future events’ (Schacter
    and Addis, 2007a, p. 27; see also Schacter and Addis, 2007b). Schacter and Addis,
    like Suddendorf and Corballis, are especially interested in the relations between
    episodic memory and a certain form of ‘personal, episodic’ future thinking: one
    in which we mentally project ourselves ahead in time by simulating our own possible
    future experiences. I think we may now flag this as another important and distinctive
    manifestation of what already looks, from the PP perspective, to be a quite fundamental
    alignment between perception, recall, and imagination. Such alignment flows directly,
    or so I have been arguing, from the basic prediction-and-generative-model-based
    perspective on perception: a perspective that may thus offer an even broader framework
    within which to conceptualize the relations between recall (of various kinds)
    and imagination (of various kinds). More generally, what seems to be emerging
    is a view of memory as intimately bound up with constructive processes of neural
    prediction and'

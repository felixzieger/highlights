- text: Without trade, innovation just does not happen. Exchange is to technology
    as sex is to evolution. It stimulates novelty.

- text: The history of human prosperity, as Robert Wright has argued, lies in the
    repeated discovery of non-zero-sum bargains that benefit both sides.

- text: For most people, therefore, the market does not feel like a virtuous place.
    It feels like an arena in which the consumer does battle with the producer to
    see who can win.

- text: Like biological evolution, the market is a bottom-up world with nobody in
    charge.
  page: Page 100
- text: 'True enough, but I see these rules and institutions as evolutionary phenomena,
    too, emerging bottom-up in society rather than being imposed top-down by fortuitously
    Solomonic rulers. They come through the filter of cultural selection just as surely
    as do technologies. And if you look at the history of, for instance, merchant
    law, you find exactly this: merchants make it up as they go along, turning their
    innovations into customs, ostracising those who break the informal rules and only
    later do monarchs subsume the rules within the laws of the land.'

- text: Human history is driven by a co-evolution of rules and tools. The increasing
    specialisation of the human species, and the enlarging habit of exchange, are
    the root cause of innovation in both.

    in 2050 in which fossil fuels have declined in importance relative to other forms
    of energy. I can envisage plug-in hybrid cars that use cheap off-peak (nuclear)
    electricity for their first twenty miles; I can imagine vast solar-power farms
    exporting electricity from sunny deserts in Algeria or Arizona; I can imagine
    hot-dry-rock geothermal plants; above all, I foresee pebble-bed, passive-safe,
    modular nuclear reactors everywhere. I can even imagine wind, tide, wave and biomass
    energy making small contributions, though these should be a last resort because
    they are so expensive and environmentally destructive. But this I know: we will
    need the watts from somewhere. They are our slaves. Thomas Edison deserves the
    last word: ‘I am ashamed at the number of things around my house and shops that
    are done by animals – human beings, I mean – and ought to be done by a motor without
    any sense of fatigue or pain. Hereafter a motor must do all the chores.’'

- text: The world of things – of pecans or power stations – is indeed often subject
    to diminishing returns. But the world of ideas is not.
  page: Page 233
- text: The possibility of new knowledge makes the steady state impossible. Somewhere
    somebody will have a new idea and that idea will enable him to invent a new combination
    of atoms both to create and to exploit imperfections in the market.
  page: Page 235
- text: 'To explain the modern global economy, then, you have to explain where this
    perpetual innovation machine came from. What kick-started the increasing returns?
    They were not planned, directed or ordered: they emerged, evolved, bottom-up,
    from specialisation and exchange. The accelerated exchange of ideas and people
    made possible by technology fuelled the accelerating growth of wealth that has
    characterised the past century. Politicians, capitalists and officials are flotsam
    bobbing upriver on the tidal bore of invention.'

- text: 'Why must the torch be passed elsewhere at all? As I have argued in the previous
    three chapters, the answer lies in two phenomena: institutions and population.
    In the past, when societies gorged on innovation, they soon allowed their babies
    to grow too numerous for their land, reducing the leisure, wealth and market that
    inventors needed (in effect, the merchant’s sons became struggling peasants again).'

- text: Lewis Mandell discovered that Americans were ‘far more likely to use credit
    cards than to approve of them’. This nicely captures the paradox of the modern
    world, that people embrace technological change and hate it at the same time.
    ‘People don’t like change,’ Michael Crichton once told me, ‘and the notion that
    technology is exciting is true for only a handful of people. The rest are depressed
    or annoyed by the changes.’ Pity the inventor’s lot then. He is the source of
    society’s enrichment and yet nobody likes what he does.

- text: 'Instead, I am going to try now to persuade you that one word will suffice
    to explain this conundrum: exchange. It is the ever-increasing exchange of ideas
    that causes the ever-increasing rate of innovation in the modern world.'

    accumulating recipes for rearranging atoms in ways that raise living standards.

    just a bigger version of the past. As Herb Stein once said, ‘If something cannot
    go on forever, then it will not.’'

- text: 'In this book I have tried to build on both Adam Smith and Charles Darwin:
    to interpret human society as the product of a long history of what the philosopher
    Dan Dennett calls ‘bubble-up’ evolution through natural selection among cultural
    rather than genetic variations, and as an emergent order generated by an invisible
    hand of individual transactions, not the product of a top-down determinism.'

- text: 'In the case of sincere seekers, the answer is only slightly less obvious:
    who of us would want to become finders, as long as our search so meaningfully
    - so nobly! - structures our time and wards off boredom, and as long as the Nothing
    - which some say lies at the end of our quest - reads at this safe distance much
    more like an unveiled threat than a veiled promise? No, we have every reason to
    remain humble seekers! We are not enlightened! The fact is that in us all lurks
    an existential terror, a powerful and altogether natural resistance to what -
    seemingly - amounts to sudden death and annihilation.'

- text: Although it is best when people have considerable knowledge and experience
    using a particular product—knowledge in the head— the designer can put sufficient
    cues into the design—knowledge in the world—that good performance results even
    in the absence of previous knowledge.

- text: Knowledge how—what psychologists call procedural knowledge—is the knowledge
    that enables a person to be a skilled musician, to return a serve in tennis, or
    to move the tongue properly when saying the phrase “frightening witches.”

- text: Knowledge of—what psychologists call declarative knowledge—includes the knowledge
    of facts and rules.

    Alfred North Whitehead stated this principle over a century ago:           It
    is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people
    when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking
    of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances
    by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking
    about them. (Alfred North Whitehead, 1911.)'

- text: As we move away from many physical aids, such as printed books and magazines,
    paper notes, and calendars, much of what we use today as knowledge in the world
    will become invisible. Yes, it will all be available on display screens, but unless
    the screens always show this material, we will have added to the burden of memory
    in the head. We may not have to remember all the details of the information stored
    away for us, but we will have to remember that it is there, that it needs to be
    redisplayed at the appropriate time for use or for reminding.

- text: The sociologist Erving Goffman calls the social constraints on acceptable
    behavior “frames,” and he shows how they govern behavior even when a person is
    in a novel situation or novel culture. Danger awaits those who deliberately violate
    the frames of a culture.

- text: Standards simplify life for everyone. At the same time, they tend to hinder
    future development. And, as discussed in Chapter 6, there are often difficult
    political struggles in finding common agreement. Nonetheless, when all else fails,
    standards are the way to proceed.

    principles, including:        •  Visible affordances and signifiers        •  Discoverability
           •  Immediacy of feedback Finally, many violate the principle of desperation:
           •  If all else fails, standardize. Standardization is indeed the fundamental
    principle of desperation: when no other solution appears possible, simply design
    everything the same way, so people only have to learn once.'

- text: Put the knowledge required to operate the technology in the world. Don’t require
    that all the knowledge must be in the head. Allow for efficient operation when
    people have learned all the requirements, when they are experts who can perform
    without the knowledge in the world, but make it possible for non-experts to use
    the knowledge in the world. This will also help experts who need to perform a
    rare, infrequently performed operation or return to the technology after a prolonged
    absence.

    trained to discover the real problems. A brilliant solution to the wrong problem
    can be worse than no solution at all: solve the correct problem.'

- text: The power of the unaided mind is highly overrated. Without external aids,
    deep, sustained reasoning is difficult. Unaided memory, thought, and reasoning
    are all limited in power. Human intelligence is highly flexible and adaptive,
    superb at inventing procedures and objects that overcome its own limits. The real
    powers come from devising external aids that enhance cognitive abilities.

- text: I dream of the power of individuals, whether alone or
    in small groups, to unleash their creative spirits, their imagination, and their
    talents to develop a wide range of innovation. New technologies promise to make
    this possible. Now, for the first time in history, individuals can share their
    ideas, their thoughts and dreams. They can produce their own products, their own
    services, and make these available to anyone in the world. All can be their own
    master, exercising whatever special talents and interests they may have. What
    drives this dream? The rise of small, efficient tools that empower individuals.

- text: I dream of a renaissance of talent, where people are empowered to create,
    to use their skills and talents. Some may wish for the safety and security of
    working for organizations. Some may wish to start new enterprises. Some may do
    this as hobbies. Some may band together into small groups and cooperatives, the
    better to assemble the variety of skills required by modern technology, to help
    share their knowledge, to teach one another, and to assemble the critical mass
    that will always be needed, even for small projects. Some may hire themselves
    out to provide the necessary skills required of large projects, while still keeping
    their own freedom and authority.

    factors that determine the costs and rewards of employing violence. Every human
    society, from the hunting band to the empire, has been informed by the interactions
    of megapolitical factors that set the prevailing version of the “laws of nature.”
    Life is always and everywhere complex. The lamb and the lion keep a delicate balance,
    interacting at the margin. If lions were suddenly more swift, they would catch
    prey that now escape. If lambs suddenly grew wings, lions would starve. The capacity
    to utilize and defend against violence is the crucial variable that alters life
    at the margin.

    a dialogue with a character in a play. It breaches a convention that helps keep
    the system functioning. Every social order incorporates among its key taboos the
    notion that people living in it should not think about how it will end and what
    rules may prevail in the new system that takes its place. Implicitly, whatever
    system exists is the last or the only system that will ever exist.

    control. They are the factors that alter the conditions under which violence pays.
    Indeed, they are so remote from any obvious means of manipulation that they are
    not even subjects of political maneuvering in a world saturated with politics.
    No one ever marched in a demonstration shouting, “Increase scale economies in
    the production process.” No banner has ever demanded, “Invent a weapons system
    that increases the importance of the infantry.” No candidate ever promised to
    “alter the balance between efficiency and magnitude in protection against violence.”
    Such slogans would be ridiculous, precisely because their goals are beyond the
    capacity of anyone to consciously affect. Yet as we will explore, these variables
    determine how the world works to a far greater degree than any political platform.

    to abandon their way of life simply because they find it amusing to do so. No
    forager ever said, “I am tired of living in prehistoric times, I would prefer
    the life of a peasant in a farming village.” Any decisive swing in patterns of
    behavior and values is invariably a response to an actual change in the conditions
    of life.

    we can clearly observe that many men have made their living, often a very good
    living, from their special skill in applying weapons of violence, and that their
    activities have had a very large part in determining what uses were made of scarce
    resources.”16 —FREDERIC C. LANE

    weather in lowering real incomes—even in wealthy regions such as North America.
    There is a strong tendency for societies to render themselves crisis-prone when
    the existing configuration of institutions has exhausted its potential. In the
    past, this tendency has often been manifested by population increases that stretched
    the carrying capacity of land to the limit. This happened both before the transition
    of the year 1000 and again at the end of the fifteenth century. The plunge in
    real income caused by crop failures and lower yields played a significant role
    in both instances in destroying the predominant institutions. Today the marginalization
    is manifested in the consumer credit markets.

- text: Balance between offense and defense. The balance between the offense and the
    defense implied by prevailing weapons technology helps determine the scale of
    political organization. When offensive capabilities are rising, the ability to
    project power at a distance predominates, jurisdictions tend to consolidate, and
    governments form on a larger scale. At other times, like now, defensive capabilities
    are rising. This makes it more costly to project power outside of core areas.
    Jurisdictions tend to devolve, and big governments break down into smaller ones.
  page: Page 81
- text: Equality and the predominance of the infantry. A key feature determining the
    degree of equality among citizens is the nature of weapons technology. Weapons
    that are relatively cheap, can be employed by nonprofessionals, and enhance the
    military importance of infantry tend to equalize power. When Thomas Jefferson
    wrote that “all men are created equal,” he was saying something that was much
    more true than a similar statement would have seemed centuries earlier. A farmer
    with his hunting rifle was not only as well armed as the typical British soldier
    with his Brown Bess, he was better armed. The farmer with the rifle could shoot
    at the soldier from a greater distance, and with greater accuracy than the soldier
    could return fire. This was a distinctly different circumstance from the Middle
    Ages, when a farmer with a pitchfork—he could not have afforded more—could scarcely
    have hoped to stand against a heavily armed knight on horseback. No one was writing
    in 1276 that “all men are created equal.” At that time, in the most manifestly
    important sense, men were not equal. A single knight exercised far more brute
    force than dozens of peasants put together.
  page: Page 81
- text: Other things being equal, the more widely dispersed key technologies are,
    the more widely dispersed power will tend to be, and the smaller the optimum scale
    of government.
  page: Page 83
- text: Wherever farming took root, violence emerged as a more important feature of
    social life. Hierarchies adept at manipulating or controlling violence came to
    dominate society.
  page: Page 88
- text: Seen in this perspective, the advent of agriculture entailed more than a change
    in diet; it also launched a great revolution in the organization of economic life
    and culture as well as a transformation of the logic of violence. Farming created
    large-scale capital assets in land and sometimes in irrigation systems. The crops
    and domesticated animals farmers raised were valuable assets. They could be stored,
    hoarded, and stolen. Because crops had to be tended over the entire growing season,
    from planting through harvest, migration away from threats became less attractive,
    especially in arid regions where opportunities to grow crops were confined to
    the small areas of the land with dependable water supplies. As escape became more
    difficult, opportunities for organized shakedowns and plunder increased. Farmers
    were subject to raids at harvesttime, which gradually raised the scale of warfare.
    This tended to increase the size of societies because contests of violence more
    often than not were won by the larger group. As competition over land and control
    of its output became more intense, societies became more stationary. A division
    of labor became more apparent. Employment and slavery arose for the first time.
    Farmers and herders specialized in producing food. Potters produced containers
    in which food was stored. Priests prayed for rain and bountiful harvests. Specialists
    in violence, the forefathers of government, increasingly devoted themselves to
    plunder and protection from plunder. Along with the priests, they became the first
    wealthy persons in history. In the early stages of agricultural societies, these
    warriors came to control a portion of the annual crop as a price of protection.
    In places where threats were minimal, yeoman farmers were sometimes able to retain
    a relatively large degree of autonomy.
  page: Page 94
- text: Decentralized authority, which optimized output under some circumstances,
    also gave rise to stronger local powers who sometimes blossomed into full-fledged
    challengers for dynastic control. Even Oriental despots were by no means free
    to do as they pleased. They had no choice but to recognize the balance of raw
    power as they found it.
  page: Page 97
- text: In general, risk-averse behavior has been common among all groups that operated
    along the margins of survival. The sheer challenge of survival in premodern societies
    always constrained the behavior of the poor. An interesting feature of this risk
    aversion, explored in The Great Reckoning, is that it reduced the range of peaceful
    economic behavior that individuals were socially permitted to adopt. Taboos and
    social constraints limited experimentation and innovative behavior, even at the
    obvious cost of forgoing potentially advantageous improvements in settled ways
    of doing things.13 This was a rational reflection of the fact that experimentation
    increases the variability of results. Greater variability means not only potentially
    greater gains but—more ominously for those at the very margin of survival—potentially
    ruinous losses.

    that is part of their virtue. They promote efficiency by removing assets from
    weak hands.

- text: Although almost no one knew it, medieval society was dying. Its death was
    neither widely anticipated nor understood. Nonetheless, the prevailing mood was
    one of deep gloom. This is common at the end of an era, as conventional thinkers
    sense that things are falling apart, that “the falcon cannot hear the falconer.”
    Yet their mental inertia is often too great to comprehend the implications of
    the emerging configurations of power. Medieval historian Johan Huizinga wrote
    of the waning days of the Middle Ages, “The chroniclers of the fifteenth century
    have, nearly all, been the dupes of an absolute misappreciation of their times,
    of which the real moving forces escaped their attention.”8 Myths Betrayed Major
    changes in the underlying dynamics of power tend to confound conventional thinkers
    because they expose myths that rationalize the old order but lack any real explanatory
    power. At the end of the Middle Ages, as now, there was a particularly wide gap
    between the received myths and reality. As Huizinga said of the Europeans in the
    late fifteenth century, “Their whole system of ideas was permeated by the fiction
    that chivalry ruled the world.”9 This has a close second in the contemporary assumption
    that it is ruled by votes and popularity contests. Neither proposition stands
    up to close scrutiny. Indeed, the idea that the course of history is determined
    by democratic tallies of wishes is every bit as silly as the medieval notion that
    it is determined by an elaborated code of manners called chivalry.

    a realistic grasp of the dynamics of power in late industrial society.

- text: In warfare, the most useful value systems induce people to behave in ways
    that short-term rational calculation would rule out. No organization could mobilize
    military power effectively if the individuals it sent into battle felt free to
    calculate where their own best advantage lay, and join in the fight or run away
    accordingly. If so, they would almost never fight.

    skill to use but were expensive to procure in quantity. Their proliferation steadily
    increased the importance of commerce as compared to agriculture, which had been
    the foundation of the feudal economy.
  page: Page 132
- text: The uniforms aptly symbolize the new relations between the warrior and the
    nation-state that went hand in hand with the transition from chivalry to citizenship.
    In effect, the new nation-state would strike a “uniform” bargain with its citizens,
    unlike the special, divergent bargains struck by the monarch or the pope with
    a long chain of vassals under feudalism.

- text: Piety and Compassion The piety that rationalized the saturation of society
    by organized religion in the late Middle Ages served the same purpose as the “compassion”
    that is meant to justify the political domination of life today. The sale of indulgences
    to satisfy a desire for piety without morals parallels lavish welfare spending
    to slake the pretense of compassion without charity. It was largely immaterial
    whether the actual effect of received practices was to improve moral character
    or save souls, just as it is largely immaterial whether a welfare program actually
    improves the lives of the people to whom it is directed. “Piety,” like “compassion,”
    was an almost superstitious invocation.

- text: Rome, like most premodern states, ultimately lacked the capacity to compel
    adherence to the monopoly of violence that the ability to starve people provides.
    The Roman state outside of Africa could not cut off water for growing crops by
    denying unsubmissive people access to the irrigation system. Such hydraulic systems
    supplied more leverage to violence than any other megapolitical configuration
    in the ancient economy. Whoever controlled the water in these societies could
    extract spoils at a level almost comparable to the percentage of total output
    absorbed by modern nation-states.

    But compared to other systems for accumulating wealth, such as a genuine laissez-faire
    enclave like colonial Hong Kong, the welfare state was inefficient. Again, less
    was more. It was precisely this inefficiency that made the welfare state supreme
    during the megapolitical conditions of the Industrial Age. When you come to understand
    why, you are much closer to recognizing what the fall of the Berlin Wall and the
    death of Communism really mean. Far from assuring that the democratic welfare
    state will be a triumphant system, as has been widely assumed, it was more like
    seeing that a fraternal twin has died of old age. The same megapolitical revolution
    that killed Communism is also likely to undermine and destroy democratic welfare
    states as

- text: But wait. You may be saying that in most jurisdictions there are many more
    voters than there are persons on the government payroll. How could it be possible
    for employees to dominate under such conditions? The welfare state emerged to
    answer exactly this quandary. Since there were not otherwise enough employees
    to create a working majority, increasing numbers of voters were effectively put
    on the payroll to receive transfer payments of all kinds.

    longer essential, as it previously had been, for rulers to negotiate with powerful
    landlords or great merchants who were, as historian Charles Tilly wrote, “in a
    position to prevent the creation of a powerful state” that would “seize their
    assets and cramp their transactions.”
  page: Page 182
- text: During the Industrial Age prior to 1989, democracy emerged as the most militarily
    effective form of government precisely because democracy made it difficult or
    impossible to impose effective limits on the commandeering of resources by the
    state. Generous provision of welfare benefits to one and all invited a majority
    of voters to become, in effect, employees of the government. This became the predominant
    political feature of all leading industrial countries because voters were in a
    weak position to effectively control the government in their role as customers
    for the service of protection.
  page: Page 185
- text: Democracy had the still more compelling advantage of creating a legitimizing
    decision rule that allowed the state to tap the resources of the well-to-do without
    having to bargain directly for their permission. In short, democracy as a decision
    mechanism was well fitted to the megapolitical conditions of the Industrial Age.
    It complemented the nation-state because it facilitated the concentration of military
    power in the hands of those running it at a time when the magnitude of force brought
    to bear was more important than the efficiency with which it was mobilized.

- text: States that could employ nationalism
  page: Page 188
- text: Nation-states formed by underlining and emphasizing characteristics that people
    held in common, particularly spoken language. This facilitated rule without the
    intervention of intermediaries. It simplified the tasks of bureaucracy. Edicts
    that need only be promulgated in one language can be dispatched more quickly and
    with less confusion than those that must be translated into a Babel of tongues.
    Nationalism, therefore, tended to lower the cost of controlling larger areas.
    Before nationalism, the early-modern state required the aid of lords, dukes, earls,
    bishops, free cities, and other corporate and ethnic intermediaries, from tax
    “farmers” to military contract merchants and mercenaries to collect revenues,
    raise troops and conduct other government functions.
  page: Page 188
- text: Throughout history, violence has been a dagger pointed at the heart of the
    economy. As Thomas Schelling shrewdly put it, “The power to hurt—to destroy things
    that somebody treasures, to inflict pain and grief—is a kind of bargaining power,
    not easy to use but used often. In the underworld it is the basis for blackmail,
    extortion, and kidnapping, in the commercial world, for boycotts, strikes, and
    lockouts.… It is often the basis for discipline, civilian and military; and gods
    use it to exact discipline.”
  page: Page 197
- text: Although we tend not to perceive it in these terms, the proportion of assets
    that are controlled and spent coercively, through crime and government, provides
    a rough measure of the megapolitical balance between extortion and protection.
    If technology made the protection of assets difficult, crime would tend to be
    widespread, and so would union activity. Under such circumstances, protection
    by government would therefore command a premium. Taxes would be high. Where taxes
    are lower and wage rates in the workplace are determined by market forces rather
    than through political intervention or coercion, technology has tipped the balance
    toward protection.

    nowhere in sight. Under the circumstances, he may well have supposed that the
    competition to employ violence in the world had reached its final stage with the
    appearance of the nation-state. There is no hint in his works that he anticipated
    microprocessing or believed that it was technologically feasible to create assets
    in cyberspace, a realm without physical existence. Lane had nothing to say about
    the implications of the possibility that large amounts of commerce could be made
    all but immune from the leverage of violence.
  page: Page 202
- text: Lane’s study of the violent medieval world attracted his attention to issues
    that conventional economists and historians have tended to neglect. He saw that
    how violence is organized and controlled plays a large role in determining “what
    uses are made of scarce resources.”8 Lane also recognized that while production
    of violence is not usually considered part of economic output, the control of
    violence is crucial to the economy.
  page: Page 202

    could employ to successfully protect your life and wealth from attack would also
    necessarily have had the capacity to take either. That is a drawback for which
    there is no easy answer. Normally, you could look to competition to keep providers
    of an economic service from ignoring the wishes of their customers. But where
    violence is concerned, direct competition often has perverse results. In the past,
    it has usually led to increased violence. When two would-be protective agencies
    send their forces to arrest one another, the result is more akin to civil war
    than protection.

    policing services to encourage trade such as that organized by the Counts of Champagne
    for merchants coming to their fairs.”46 In other words, when they were able to
    establish a sufficient control over territory to negotiate credibly, local warlords
    did what local merchants do when they need to increase market share: they discounted
    their services to attract customers. The warlords later used the added resources
    from additional economic activity to consolidate their control over larger territories.

    in a disordered environment with more competitive violence, even if the result
    of the competition had been to shrink the overall share of output taken by government.
    This is why capital-intensive operations are uneconomic in the American slums,
    as well as in Third World societies where ad hoc violence is endemic. Industrial
    society as a whole was able to proceed because a certain kind of order was established
    and maintained. Enterprises were subject to regular, predictable shakedowns, rather
    than erratic violence.

    who became wealthy by circumventing the economic sanctions against the former
    apartheid regime. Now he faces the danger of economic retribution by the new South
    African government and is willing to pay the Seychelles for protection.52 Whatever
    the merits of any individual case, the example shows why attempts by governments
    to maintain a cartel for protection on the ground are doomed to failure. Unlike
    the medieval frontier, in which the competition was between two authorities only,
    the frontier in cybercommerce will be between hundreds of jurisdictions, with
    the number probably rising rapidly to thousands. In the age of the virtual corporation,
    individuals will choose to domicile their income-earning activities in a jurisdiction
    that provides the best service at the lowest cost. In other words, sovereignty
    will be commercialized. Unlike medieval frontier societies, which were in most
    cases impoverished and violent, cyberspace will be neither. The competition that
    information technology is driving governments to engage in is not competition
    of a military kind, but competition in quality and price of an economic service
    —genuine protection. In short, governments will be obliged to give customers what
    they want.

    only by generating profits from depreciating the currency, but by giving the state
    leverage over who could accumulate wealth. As Abu-Lughod put it, “when paper money
    backed by the state become the approved currency, the chances for amassing capital
    in opposition to or independent of the state machinery became difficult.”

    He wrote, “although we usually assume there is a sharp line of distinction between
    what is money and what is not—and the law generally tries to make such a distinction—so
    far as the causal effects of monetary events are concerned, there is no such clear
    difference. What we find is rather a continuum in which objects of various degrees
    of liquidity, or with values which can fluctuate independently of each other,
    shade into each other in the degree to which they function as money.”

    emergence of new types of businesses that heretofore could not have existed, specializing
    in organizing the distribution of low-value information. The vendors of this information
    will now be compensated through direct-debit royalty schemes that overcome previously
    daunting transaction costs.

    prospects for the global economy should be highly bullish. Whenever circumstances
    allow people to reduce protection costs and minimize tribute paid to those who
    control organized violence, the economy usually grows dramatically. As Lane said,
    “I would like to suggest that the most weighty single factor in most periods of
    growth, if any one factor has been most important, has been a reduction in the
    proportion of resources devoted to war and police.”

- text: Some technologies have been relatively egalitarian, requiring contributions
    of many independent workers of approximately equal utility; others have put power
    or wealth into the hands of a few masters while most people were little more than
    serfs. Both history and technology have shaped different nations in different
    ways. The Factory Age produced one shape, and the Information Age is producing
    another, less violent, and therefore more elitist and less egalitarian than the
    one it is replacing.

- text: In the Information Age, familiar locational advantages will rapidly be transformed
    by technology. Earnings capacity for persons of similar skills will become much
    more equal, no matter in what jurisdiction they live. This has already begun to
    happen. Because institutions that have employed compulsion and local advantage
    to redistribute income are losing power, income inequality within jurisdictions
    will rise. Global competition will also tend to increase the income earned by
    the most talented individuals in each field, wherever they live, much as it does
    now in professional athletics. The marginal value generated by superior performance
    in a global market will be huge.

    is the “entrepreneurial mode,” “wherein each workstation is owned and operated
    by a specialist.”27 Another is what Williamson calls the “federated workstations”
    in which “an intermediate product is transferred across stages by each worker.”28
    There is no physical reason why the thousands of employees could not have been
    replaced by a gaggle of independent contractors, each renting space on the factory
    floor, bidding for parts, and offering to assemble the axle or weld the fenders
    onto the chassis. Yet you would look in vain for an example of an industrial-era
    automobile factory organized

    it is listed on page thirty of the strategic plan. A market has no job boundaries.…
    There are no orders, no translation of signals from on high, no one sorting out
    the work into parcels. In a market one has customers, and the relationship between
    a supplier and a customer is fundamentally nonorganizational, because it is between
    two independent entities.”31 —WILLIAM BRIDGES

- text: In the postindustrial period, jobs will be tasks you do, not something you
    “have.” Before the industrial era, permanent employment was almost unknown. As
    William Bridges put it, “Before 1800—and long after in many cases—job always referred
    to some particular task or undertaking, never to a role or position in an organization.…
    Between 1700 and 1890, the Oxford English Dictionary finds many uses of terms
    like job-coachman, job-doctor, and job-gardener—all referring to people hired
    on a one-time basis. Job-work (another frequent term) was occasional work, not
    regular employment.”34 In the Information Age, most tasks that were formerly captured
    within firms as an expedient to reduce information and transaction costs will
    migrate back to the spot market.

    production company. Such enterprises can be very sophisticated, with budgets of
    hundreds of millions of dollars. While they are often large operations, they are
    also temporary in nature. A movie company producing a film for $100 million may
    come together for a year and then dissolve. While the people who work on the production
    are talented, they have no expectation that finding work on the project is equivalent
    to having a “permanent job.” When the project is over, the lighting technicians,
    cameramen, sound engineers, and wardrobe specialists will go their separate ways.
    They may be reunited in another project, or they may not. As scale economies fall,
    and capital requirements for many types of information-intensive activities fall
    simultaneously, there will be a strong incentive for firms to dissolve.

    as “international” shows how deeply the nationalist paradigm has penetrated into
    our way of conceiving the world. After two centuries of indoctrination in the

    overlook that “international” is not a longstanding Western concept.

    paradoxes of “altruism” are semantic muddles that frequently confuse or mislead
    people into losing sight of the context of competition in which “helping” could
    convey a survival advantage: “ ‘If an altruism choice of strategy is to be viable
    in competition with non-altruism, altruism must contribute to self-survival more
    than non-altruism does, and therefore it can’t really be altruism.’'

    consciousness among the capitalists, many of whom will become Sovereign Individuals.
    Far from depending upon the state to discipline the workers, as the Marxists imagined,
    the ablest, wealthiest persons were net losers from the actions of the nation-state.
    It is clearly they who have the most to gain by transcending nationalism as markets
    triumph over compulsion.

    the innovation of industrial technologies that the world experienced in recent
    centuries. The difference lies in the fact that most current technological innovations
    with labor-saving characteristics tend to create skilled tasks and reduce scale
    economies.

    competing with rival violence-using enterprises or establishing a territorial
    monopoly. This fact is basic for the economic analysis of one aspect of government:
    the violence-using, violence-controlling industry was a natural monopoly, at least
    on land. Within territorial limits the service it rendered could be produced much
    more cheaply by a monopoly. To be sure, there have been times when violence-using
    enterprises competed in demanding payments for protection in almost the same territory,
    for example, during the Thirty Years’ War in Germany. But such a situation was
    even more uneconomic than would be competition in the same territories between
    rival telephone systems.'

    the superiority of the defense in military technology, contributes to the dynamic
    stability of anarchy. Therefore, the apparent impact of information technology
    in reducing the decisiveness of military action should make the anarchy between
    minisovereignties more stable and less prone to be replaced through conquest by
    a large government. Less decisiveness in battle also implies less fighting,

    governments if they could be paid on the basis of results they actually achieve
    for society. A leader who could significantly boost real income in any leading
    Western nation could justly be paid far more than Michael Eisner. In a better
    world, every successful head of government would be a multimillionaire.

- text: What we now think of as “political” leadership, which is always conceived
    in terms of a nation-state, will become increasingly entrepreneurial rather than
    political in nature. In these conditions, the viable range of choice in putting
    together a “policy” regime for a jurisdiction will be effectively narrowed in
    the same way that the range of options open to entrepreneurs in designing a first-class
    resort hotel or any similar product or service is defined by what people will
    pay for. A resort hotel, for example, would seldom attempt to operate on terms
    that required guests to perform hard labor to repair and extend its facilities.
    Even a resort hotel owned or controlled by its employees, like the typical modern
    democracy, would try in vain to force customers to comply with such demands, especially
    after better accommodations became available. If the customers would rather play
    golf than do heavy labor in the hot sun, then on that question, at least, the
    market offers little scope for imposing arbitrary alternatives. In such conditions,
    presently “political” issues will recede into entrepreneurial judgments, as fragmented
    jurisdictions seek to discover which policy bundles will attract a viable cross-section
    of customers.

- text: As the monopoly on violence enjoyed by the “bigger battalions” breaks down,
    one of the first results to be expected is increasing prosperity for organized
    crime. Organized crime, after all, provides the main competition to nation-states
    in employing violence for predatory purposes.

- text: The alternative to destructive “interference” competition is collaborative
    competition, and collaborative competition is the central idea of Adam Smith,
    and also of Malthus and of William James. The archetype of destructive competition
    is the conqueror. He destroys his competitors in order to seize their assets,
    which may include taking over their countries and may involve the enslavement
    of their peoples. The archetype of collaborative competition is the merchant.
    It is in the interest of the merchant that the customer should be satisfied with
    the transaction, because only a satisfied customer comes back for more trade.
    It is also in the interest of the merchant that the customer should be prosperous,
    because a prosperous customer has the money to go on buying. Conquest implies
    the destruction of the other party; commerce implies the satisfaction of the other
    party. As modern technology has made conquest an extraordinarily dangerous policy,
    commerce has become the only rational approach to the problems of survival.

    progress. If we all still believed that the sun revolved around the earth, then
    we could not have developed satellite communications. Indeed what we believe to

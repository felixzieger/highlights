But I don’t think I’ve ever seen any one die.” “Nor have I till to-day,” said the girl, and shivered a little. “The euthanasia people were soon at work.” Oliver took her hand gently. “My darling, it must have been frightful. Why, you’re trembling still.” “No; but listen.… You know, if I had had anything to say I could have said it too. They were all just in front of me: I wondered; then I knew I hadn’t. I couldn’t possibly have talked about Humanity.”</p>

He tried not to reflect on his fellow-priests, but for the fiftieth time he could not help seeing that they were not the men for the present situation. It was not that he preferred himself; he knew perfectly well that he, too, was fully as incompetent: had he not proved to be so with poor Father Francis, and scores of others who had clutched at him in their agony during the last ten years? Even the Archbishop, holy man as he was, with all his childlike faith—was that the man to lead English Catholics and confound their enemies? There seemed no giants on the earth in these days. What in the world was to be done? He buried his face in his hands.… Yes; what was wanted was a new Order in the Church; the old ones were rule-bound through no fault of their own.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">For herself the new worship was a crowning sign of the triumph of Humanity. Her heart had yearned for some such thing as this—some public corporate profession of what all now believed. She had so resented the dulness of folk who were content with action and never considered its springs. Surely this instinct within her was a true one; she desired to stand with her fellows in some solemn place, consecrated not by priests but by the will of man; to have as her inspirers sweet singing and the peal of organs; to utter her sorrow with thousands beside her at her own feebleness of immolation before the Spirit of all; to sing aloud her praise of the glory of life, and to offer by sacrifice and incense an emblematic homage to That from which she drew her being, and to whom one day she must render it again. Ah! these Christians had understood human nature, she had told herself a hundred times: it was true that they had degraded it, darkened light, poisoned thought, misinterpreted instinct; but they had understood that man must worship—must worship or sink.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">A WEEK later Mabel awoke about dawn; and for a moment or two forgot where she was. She even spoke Oliver’s name aloud, staring round the unfamiliar room, wondering what she did here. Then she remembered, and was silent.… It was the eighth day she had spent in this Home; her probation was finished: to-day she was at liberty to do that for which she had come. On the Saturday of the previous week she had gone through her private examination before the magistrate, stating under the usual conditions of secrecy her name, age and home, as well as her reasons for making the application for Euthanasia; and all had passed off well. She had selected Manchester as being sufficiently remote and sufficiently large to secure her freedom from Oliver’s molestation; and her secret had been admirably kept. There was not a hint that her husband knew anything of her intentions; for, after all, in these cases the police were bound to assist the fugitive. Individualism was at least so far recognised as to secure to those weary of life the right of relinquishing it. She scarcely knew why she had selected this method, except that any other seemed impossible. The knife required skill and resolution; firearms were unthinkable, and poison, under the new stringent regulations, was hard to obtain. Besides, she seriously wished to test her own intentions, and to be quite sure that there was no other way than this.… Well, she was as certain as ever. The thought had first come to her in the mad misery of the outbreak of violence on the last day of the old year. Then it had gone again, soothed away by the arguments that man was still liable to relapse. Then once more it had recurred, a cold and convincing phantom, in the plain daylight revealed by Felsenburgh’s Declaration. It had taken up its abode with her then, yet she controlled it, hoping against hope that the Declaration would not be carried into action, occasionally revolting against its horror. Yet it had never been far away; and finally when the policy sprouted into deliberate law, she had yielded herself resolutely to its suggestion. That was eight days ago; and she had not had one moment of faltering since that. Yet she had ceased to condemn. The logic had silenced her. All that she knew was that she could not bear it; that she had misconceived the New Faith; that for her, whatever it was for others, there was no hope.… She had not even a child of her own. Those eight days, required by law, had passed very peacefully. She had taken with her enough money to enter one of the private homes furnished with sufficient comfort to save from distractions those who had been accustomed to gentle living: the nurses had been pleasant and sympathetic; she had nothing to complain of. She had suffered, of course, to some degree from reactions. The second night after her arrival had been terrible, when as she lay in bed in the hot darkness, her whole sentient life had protested and struggled against the fate her will ordained. It had demanded the familiar things—the promise of food and breath and human intercourse; it had writhed in horror against the blind dark towards which it moved so inevitably; and, in the agony had been pacified only by the half-hinted promise of some deeper voice suggesting that death was not the end. With morning light sanity had come back; the will had reassumed the mastery, and, with it, had withdrawn explicitly the implied hope of continued existence.</p>

Mill wanted people to act on their inspiration because “the worth of different modes of life should be proved practically when anyone thinks fit to try them.”91 By choosing a unique and personal fixed point, in Mill’s view, you are not only raising the odds of finding a path worth staying on, but you are also serving an important role in pushing culture forward.</p>

He argues, “the secret of the world is that it is a very malleable place, we must be sure that people learn this, and never forget the order: Learning is naturally the consequence of doing.”158 In other words, only by taking action do we learn and only by learning do we discover what we want. Without this, we will struggle to take advantage of the freedom that the pathless path offers.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">One way to think about low interest rates is that from a financial perspective, they make everything happen at once. If one dollar in 10 years is worth about as much as one dollar today, the timing of profits doesn’t matter. But everything is not what needs to happen; the bubbles and megaprojects that produce transformative innovation are specific events. Initially, these developments resist categorization because they occur before there’s even a defined category, sector, or industry for them. The atomic bomb preceded the “defense space”; the “space industry” emerged decades after Apollo; “crypto” followed Bitcoin. What does accelerate progress is a concentration of effective people working on adjacent problems.</p>

Consequently, “creative destruction without destruction,” “capitalism without bankruptcy,” and “risk without consequences” essentially amount to Christianity without Hell. And since Hell is not an attractive political pitch, the technocratic policies of perpetual risk suppression constantly create more systemic risk the harder they attempt to annihilate it. Naturally, eternal stagnation is preferred over economic collapse, which is not a political option. Stagnation, in other words, is a choice.</p>

If you want to know if the bath is ready you are told that the Son was made out of nothing.” A visit to a modern college campus might produce a similar observation. Higher education is now the site of an irresistible drive to moralize and politicize everything, which in turn imposes self-censorship and a risk-averse culture.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">In April 2023, as SpaceX prepared the experimental launch of Starship, its flagship rocket, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk lamented the “soul-sucking” process of getting all of the safety reviews and requirements that the dozen or so regulatory agencies demanded. Holding his head, Musk said, “I’m trying to figure out how we get humanity to Mars with all this bullshit.” Later, he added, “This is how civilizations decline. They quit taking risks. And when they quit taking risks, their arteries harden. Every year there are more referees and fewer doers. That’s why America could no longer build things like high-speed rail or rockets that go to the Moon. When you’ve had success for too long, you lose the desire to take risks.” 131 We need to cultivate and catalyze boldness and exuberant risk-taking, stop the decline Musk deplored, and find a way to channel our thymotic energies into something radically new. To that end, we now turn to an unexpected but highly effective vehicle for enabling just such a Promethean spirit of risk-taking: speculative bubbles.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">FOMO, like many aspects of human psychology, is a bug that has evolved into a feature. It’s generally not great that we as a species exhibit herdlike behavior, of which FOMO is just one example. But such behavior also functions as a coordination mechanism. Since good bubbles function by aligning people and capital to work on the right problem at the same time, FOMO helps ensure everyone gets on board at once. If a bubble only excites people who are early in their careers, it won’t be able to marshal the institutional and financial resources necessary to reach fruition. If a bubble only grabs the attention of people who are late in their careers, it will end up constrained by existing paradigms. If a bubble excites speculators but not entrepreneurs, it will bid up assets without building anything. If a bubble only convinces founders to act, it will be starved for capital. All of these people need to participate in the bubble at the same time, and FOMO can bring them together.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">Financial bubbles emerge when perception and reality diverge. When this happens, one of two things eventually occurs: either perception moves closer to reality or reality bends in the direction of perception. In the former case, bubbles can result in spectacular crashes that annihilate value and wealth. In the latter, they serve as a necessary catalyst for massive technological acceleration, as some of the bubbles we document in this book demonstrate. Nevertheless, given the potential for ruin that inevitably accompanies a bubble, some readers will remain skeptical of their value. Why not merely pursue safe, incremental progress? To address this alternative, it’s worth considering a world without financial bubbles—a world where no one gets too excited about the possibilities of the future because no one is excited about the future at all.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">By contrast, in a static economy, everyone’s gain comes at someone else’s expense. Corporate profits can rise, but only if they come out of labor’s share of national income or from lower taxes, which will result in higher inflation or fewer government services. In a no- or slow-growth environment, disputes involve not how to fairly divide the spoils of winning but who will lose out. Instead of looking forward to a brighter future, people are inclined to worry about how much worse their future will be than their present, and to attribute such worsening to the behavior of others. Under such circumstances, ambitious people will be attracted to jobs that involve zero-sum games: adversarial politics, irresponsible speculation, fraud, even revolutions and coups. From this perspective, bubbles can be seen as an outlet for restless energy. They offer a domain where the Stalins, the Cesare Borgias, and other ruthless types can satisfy their ambition by participating in positive-sum games. Indeed, there is a strong, empirically documented relationship between a zero-sum mindset and the economic environment: The more adverse the economic environment, the less positive-sum the thinking becomes. Scarcity thinking kicks off a self-reinforcing doom loop, which results in more scarcity.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">There’s a sense in which participating in bubbles speaks to an important aspect of the human condition. People want to transcend limitations, and a world without bubbles is a world defined by preexisting limitations. In economic terms, it’s a bit like living in the ruins of a once-advanced but now departed civilization. In his book The Decline of the West, German historian Oswald Spengler contrasted an Apollonian culture, obsessed with the present, with a Faustian culture, which looks toward the infinite and the transcendent. Bubbles are deeply Faustian. When they work, they’re a way for participants to look back and look down on the more mundane parts of the world.</p>

It only works when valuable local knowledge—tacit knowledge—can be profitably harnessed by large groups and organizations. In other words, what’s needed is a mechanism, like prices in a free-market system, that aggregates knowledge to make it globally accessible. In the case of Apollo, handwritten notes functioned as information-aggregation mechanisms. In von Braun’s system of “Monday notes,” engineers and technicians were required to identify the most salient issues and submit a single-page note. After leaving comments in the margins, von Braun would circulate the entire annotated collection of notes within the organization. Through this informal system, everyone was able to tap into the organization’s collective knowledge and contribute solutions to each other’s problems. There was one level of centralization, with von Braun serving as the hub for information, but his role was really to highlight problems in a way that facilitated decentralized solutions.</p>

In the 20th century, the experience of the technological sublime was a recurrent phenomenon in America—think of the interstate highway system, the Hoover Dam, the Manhattan skyline, the atomic bomb, the jet airplane, or the Golden Gate Bridge.

          <p class="highlight__text">Today, a lack of transcendent vision is the ultimate source of the crisis of meaning and the techno-economic and cultural stagnation that inflicts the West. But nascent bubbles in sectors like space exploration, AI, and renewable energy offer promise that this transcendent impulse has not entirely disappeared. We’re by no means suggesting that the visionary technologists who realize the breakthroughs of the future all need to be deeply committed Christian believers. 396 But we predict that they will most likely exhibit a deeply spiritual—and, in some cases, explicitly religious—impulse toward realizing and participating in something transcendent. They will be attracted to a Promethean vision that transcends the limitations of the present and rationalizes the sacrifices and risk-taking its actualization demands. What is truly scarce are not natural resources or new ideas but the human will and courage to unlock nature’s intrinsic superabundance. There are no limits to growth, only the growth of limits. Scarcity isn’t a built-in feature of our world; the universe produces more energy and offers more matter than we could ever desire to capture, convert, and consume.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">Tolstoy stood at the opposite pole to all this. He believed that only by patient empirical observation could any knowledge be obtained; that this knowledge is always inadequate, that simple people often know the truth better than learned men, because their observation of men and nature is less clouded by empty theories, and not because they are inspired vehicles of the divine afflatus.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">Consequently the fuller our knowledge of facts and of their connections the more difficult to conceive alternatives; the clearer and more exact the terms – or categories – in which we conceive and describe the world, the more fixed our world structure, the less ‘free’ acts seem. To know these limits, both of imagination and, ultimately, of thought itself, is to come face to face with the ‘inexorable’ unifying pattern of the world; to realise our identity with it, to submit to it, is to find truth and peace. This is not mere oriental fatalism, nor the mechanistic determinism of the celebrated German materialists of the day, Büchner and Vogt, or Moleschott, admired so deeply by the revolutionary ‘nihilists’ of Tolstoy’s generation in Russia; nor is it a yearning for mystical illumination or integration. It is scrupulously empirical, rational, tough-minded and realistic. But its emotional cause is a passionate desire for a monistic vision of life on the part of a fox bitterly intent upon seeing in the manner of a hedgehog.</p>

Both looked for a harmonious universe, but everywhere found war and disorder, which no attempt to cheat, however heavily disguised, could even begin to hide; and so, in a condition of final despair, offered to throw away the terrible weapons of criticism with which both, but particularly Tolstoy, were over-generously endowed, in favour of the single great vision, something too indivisibly simple and remote from normal intellectual processes to be assailable by the instruments of reason, and therefore, perhaps, offering a path to peace and salvation.</p>

No greater poet than Dante, no greater philosopher than Plato, no profounder novelist than Dostoevsky exists; yet, of course, they seem to me to have been hedgehogs, and although I do think that they were fanatical unitarians – and that this can lead to disastrous consequences in social, personal and political life – this is the price that may be paid for forms of genius which may well be profounder than any other. I may have more personal sympathy with foxes; I may think that they are politically more enlightened, tolerant and humane; but this does not imply they are otherwise more valuable – if such comparisons of incommensurables make sense at all.</p>

Some analysts saw evidence of a broader manufacturing decay that started in steel, then afflicted cars, and was now spreading to high-tech industries. In 1987, Nobel Prize−winning MIT economist Robert Solow, who pioneered the study of productivity and economic growth, argued that the chip industry suffered from an “unstable structure,” with employees job hopping between firms and companies declining to invest in their workers. Prominent economist Robert Reich lamented the “paper entrepreneurialism” in Silicon Valley, which he thought focused too much on the search for prestige and affluence rather than technical advances.</p>

In the years after Vietnam, the U.S. military had talked about its new capabilities, but many people didn’t take them seriously. Military leaders like General William Westmoreland, who commanded American forces in Vietnam, promised that future battlefields would be automated. But the Vietnam War had gone disastrously despite America’s wide technological advantage over the North Vietnamese.</p>

The new class of CEOs who took over America’s semiconductor firms in the 2000s and 2010s tended to speak the language of MBAs as well as PhDs, chatting casually about capex and margins with Wall Street analysts on quarterly earnings calls. By most measures this new generation of executive talent was far more professional than the chemists and physicists who’d built Silicon Valley. But they often seemed stale in comparison to the giants who preceded them. An era of wild wagers on impossible technologies was being superseded by something more organized, professionalized, and rationalized. Bet-the-house gambles were replaced by calculated risk management. It was hard to escape the sense that something was lost in the process.</p>

Though its theory was hierarchical – indeed, like John Buchan, Victorian racial theorists ranked mankind according to inherited levels of intelligence – its practice was to delegate considerable power to local rulers and private networks. Unlike Napoleon’s short-lived European empire, the British Empire was not run by a micro-managing genius, but by a club of gentlemanly amateurs, whose seemingly effortless superiority depended on the unsung strivings of local agents and native collaborators.</p>

Yet it could always survive such catastrophes, if only because their effect was to kill off any kind of opposition.

On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear … Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions … Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications … We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.

A skepticism of government work and national ambition took hold in the Valley. The grand, collectivist experiments of the earlier part of the twentieth century were discarded in favor of a narrow attentiveness to the desires and needs of the individual. The market rewarded shallow engagement with the potential of technology, as startup after startup catered to the whims of late capitalist culture without any interest in constructing the technical infrastructure that would address our most significant challenges as a nation. The age of social media platforms and food delivery apps had arrived. Medical breakthroughs, education reform, and military advances would have to wait.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">“To be coercive, violence has to be anticipated,” he wrote in the 1960s as the United States grappled with its military escalation in Vietnam. “The power to hurt is bargaining power. To exploit it is diplomacy—vicious diplomacy, but diplomacy.” The virtue of Schelling’s version of realism was its unsentimental disentanglement of the moral from the strategic. As he made clear, “War is always a bargaining process.” Before one engages with the justice or injustice of a policy, it is necessary to understand one’s leverage or lack thereof in a negotiation, armed or otherwise. The contemporary approach to international affairs too often assumes, either explicitly or implicitly, that the correctness of one’s views from a moral or ethical perspective precludes the need to engage with the more distasteful and fundamental question of relative power with respect to a geopolitical opponent, and specifically which party has a superior ability to inflict harm on the other.</p>

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, a talented graduate could perhaps join Goldman Sachs, which was a pioneer of partnership compensation models, or perhaps a white-shoe law firm, where attorneys shared the profits, and risk, of their work. But those experiments have essentially withered; such firms still attract talented and ambitious minds, but they are paid salaries, often high ones, but salaries nonetheless. The upside of the endeavors and creative energy of labor is captured by the capitalists.</p>

But it is thin and can wither under even the slightest scrutiny. The legions of young founders have for decades now routinely claimed that they aspire to change the world. Yet such claims have grown meaningless from overuse. This cloak of idealism was put on in order to relieve these young founders of the need to develop anything approaching a more substantial worldview. And the nation-state itself, the most effective means of collective organization in pursuit of a shared purpose that the world has ever known, was cast aside as an obstacle to progress.</p>

The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.

          <p class="highlight__text">I dream of the power of individuals, whether alone or in small groups, to unleash their creative spirits, their imagination, and their talents to develop a wide range of innovation. New technologies promise to make this possible. Now, for the first time in history, individuals can share their ideas, their thoughts and dreams. They can produce their own products, their own services, and make these available to anyone in the world. All can be their own master, exercising whatever special talents and interests they may have. What drives this dream? The rise of small, efficient tools that empower individuals.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">I dream of a renaissance of talent, where people are empowered to create, to use their skills and talents. Some may wish for the safety and security of working for organizations. Some may wish to start new enterprises. Some may do this as hobbies. Some may band together into small groups and cooperatives, the better to assemble the variety of skills required by modern technology, to help share their knowledge, to teach one another, and to assemble the critical mass that will always be needed, even for small projects. Some may hire themselves out to provide the necessary skills required of large projects, while still keeping their own freedom and authority.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">The implicit conceptual model behind any unconstrained optimistic or pessimistic view of progress is that it is deterministic and automatic. According to many variants of techno-optimism or “doomerism,” progress just happens—either the Singularity arrives or civilization collapses. 5 But progress isn’t mechanistic. It is spectacularly singular and requires an explicit and unified vision of the future.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">One way to think about low interest rates is that from a financial perspective, they make everything happen at once. If one dollar in 10 years is worth about as much as one dollar today, the timing of profits doesn’t matter. But everything is not what needs to happen; the bubbles and megaprojects that produce transformative innovation are specific events. Initially, these developments resist categorization because they occur before there’s even a defined category, sector, or industry for them. The atomic bomb preceded the “defense space”; the “space industry” emerged decades after Apollo; “crypto” followed Bitcoin. What does accelerate progress is a concentration of effective people working on adjacent problems.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">On the contrary, policies designed to preserve or optimize abstract macroeconomic aggregates, such as “wealth” or “employment,” tend to inhibit the vital process of constant industrial revolution—which, according to Schumpeter, involves the perpetual creation and destruction of concrete, machines, material infrastructures, and industries. Consequently, “creative destruction without destruction,” “capitalism without bankruptcy,” and “risk without consequences” essentially amount to Christianity without Hell. And since Hell is not an attractive political pitch, the technocratic policies of perpetual risk suppression constantly create more systemic risk the harder they attempt to annihilate it. Naturally, eternal stagnation is preferred over economic collapse, which is not a political option. Stagnation, in other words, is a choice.</p>

        <li class="highlight" id="a+15th-century+">
          <p class="highlight__text">A 15th-century visitor to Constantinople, the ancient capital of a dying empire, remarked that the citizens were not obsessed with the existential threats to their lives but with obscure theological debates: “If you ask a man to change money he will tell you how the Son differs from the Father. If you ask the price of a loaf he will argue that the Son is less than the Father. If you want to know if the bath is ready you are told that the Son was made out of nothing.” A visit to a modern college campus might produce a similar observation. Higher education is now the site of an irresistible drive to moralize and politicize everything, which in turn imposes self-censorship and a risk-averse culture.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">In April 2023, as SpaceX prepared the experimental launch of Starship, its flagship rocket, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk lamented the “soul-sucking” process of getting all of the safety reviews and requirements that the dozen or so regulatory agencies demanded. Holding his head, Musk said, “I’m trying to figure out how we get humanity to Mars with all this bullshit.” Later, he added, “This is how civilizations decline. They quit taking risks. And when they quit taking risks, their arteries harden. Every year there are more referees and fewer doers. That’s why America could no longer build things like high-speed rail or rockets that go to the Moon. When you’ve had success for too long, you lose the desire to take risks.” 131 We need to cultivate and catalyze boldness and exuberant risk-taking, stop the decline Musk deplored, and find a way to channel our thymotic energies into something radically new. To that end, we now turn to an unexpected but highly effective vehicle for enabling just such a Promethean spirit of risk-taking: speculative bubbles.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">FOMO, like many aspects of human psychology, is a bug that has evolved into a feature. It’s generally not great that we as a species exhibit herdlike behavior, of which FOMO is just one example. But such behavior also functions as a coordination mechanism. Since good bubbles function by aligning people and capital to work on the right problem at the same time, FOMO helps ensure everyone gets on board at once. If a bubble only excites people who are early in their careers, it won’t be able to marshal the institutional and financial resources necessary to reach fruition. If a bubble only grabs the attention of people who are late in their careers, it will end up constrained by existing paradigms. If a bubble excites speculators but not entrepreneurs, it will bid up assets without building anything. If a bubble only convinces founders to act, it will be starved for capital. All of these people need to participate in the bubble at the same time, and FOMO can bring them together.</p>

        <li class="highlight" id="financial+bubbl">
          <p class="highlight__text">Financial bubbles emerge when perception and reality diverge. When this happens, one of two things eventually occurs: either perception moves closer to reality or reality bends in the direction of perception. In the former case, bubbles can result in spectacular crashes that annihilate value and wealth. In the latter, they serve as a necessary catalyst for massive technological acceleration, as some of the bubbles we document in this book demonstrate. Nevertheless, given the potential for ruin that inevitably accompanies a bubble, some readers will remain skeptical of their value. Why not merely pursue safe, incremental progress? To address this alternative, it’s worth considering a world without financial bubbles—a world where no one gets too excited about the possibilities of the future because no one is excited about the future at all.</p>

        <li class="highlight" id="by+contrast%2C+">
          <p class="highlight__text">By contrast, in a static economy, everyone’s gain comes at someone else’s expense. Corporate profits can rise, but only if they come out of labor’s share of national income or from lower taxes, which will result in higher inflation or fewer government services. In a no- or slow-growth environment, disputes involve not how to fairly divide the spoils of winning but who will lose out. Instead of looking forward to a brighter future, people are inclined to worry about how much worse their future will be than their present, and to attribute such worsening to the behavior of others. Under such circumstances, ambitious people will be attracted to jobs that involve zero-sum games: adversarial politics, irresponsible speculation, fraud, even revolutions and coups. From this perspective, bubbles can be seen as an outlet for restless energy. They offer a domain where the Stalins, the Cesare Borgias, and other ruthless types can satisfy their ambition by participating in positive-sum games. Indeed, there is a strong, empirically documented relationship between a zero-sum mindset and the economic environment: The more adverse the economic environment, the less positive-sum the thinking becomes. Scarcity thinking kicks off a self-reinforcing doom loop, which results in more scarcity.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">There’s a sense in which participating in bubbles speaks to an important aspect of the human condition. People want to transcend limitations, and a world without bubbles is a world defined by preexisting limitations. In economic terms, it’s a bit like living in the ruins of a once-advanced but now departed civilization. In his book The Decline of the West, German historian Oswald Spengler contrasted an Apollonian culture, obsessed with the present, with a Faustian culture, which looks toward the infinite and the transcendent. Bubbles are deeply Faustian. When they work, they’re a way for participants to look back and look down on the more mundane parts of the world.</p>

The extreme willingness to take risks, constantly reinforced by unrealistic levels of optimism, may not sound rational, but it put a man on the Moon.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">Of course, decentralization isn’t inherently a good thing. It only works when valuable local knowledge—tacit knowledge—can be profitably harnessed by large groups and organizations. In other words, what’s needed is a mechanism, like prices in a free-market system, that aggregates knowledge to make it globally accessible. In the case of Apollo, handwritten notes functioned as information-aggregation mechanisms. In von Braun’s system of “Monday notes,” engineers and technicians were required to identify the most salient issues and submit a single-page note. After leaving comments in the margins, von Braun would circulate the entire annotated collection of notes within the organization. Through this informal system, everyone was able to tap into the organization’s collective knowledge and contribute solutions to each other’s problems. There was one level of centralization, with von Braun serving as the hub for information, but his role was really to highlight problems in a way that facilitated decentralized solutions.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">Apollo was nothing less than an instance of the technological sublime. The Apollo 11 mission, and the technological mastery a successful Moon landing represented, elicited a cross-cultural spiritual reaction. Images from the mission were “surrounded with the aura of religion,” from the silvery Saturn V rocket, which towered against the darkness of space before it lifted off and sent the first humans to another world, to the Apollo 8 crew’s reading from the Book of Genesis on Christmas Eve 1968, to Armstrong’s footprints on the lunar surface. In the 20th century, the experience of the technological sublime was a recurrent phenomenon in America—think of the interstate highway system, the Hoover Dam, the Manhattan skyline, the atomic bomb, the jet airplane, or the Golden Gate Bridge. After Apollo, that experience essentially vanished.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">Rapid advances in hardware and software, while ensuring the good fortune of the industry, didn’t guarantee that any single participant could passively maintain market share. Every player had to relentlessly catch each new wave of advances. A 70-year logarithmic chart makes advances in chip density look like a smooth process, but each advance was a discrete, step-function change. Companies that were even a few months early or late would miss out on sales but would still bear the fixed cost of research and development as well as their capital expenditures.</p>

But nascent bubbles in sectors like space exploration, AI, and renewable energy offer promise that this transcendent impulse has not entirely disappeared. We’re by no means suggesting that the visionary technologists who realize the breakthroughs of the future all need to be deeply committed Christian believers. 396 But we predict that they will most likely exhibit a deeply spiritual—and, in some cases, explicitly religious—impulse toward realizing and participating in something transcendent. They will be attracted to a Promethean vision that transcends the limitations of the present and rationalizes the sacrifices and risk-taking its actualization demands. What is truly scarce are not natural resources or new ideas but the human will and courage to unlock nature’s intrinsic superabundance. There are no limits to growth, only the growth of limits. Scarcity isn’t a built-in feature of our world; the universe produces more energy and offers more matter than we could ever desire to capture, convert, and consume.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">Tolstoy stood at the opposite pole to all this.

          <p class="highlight__text">Consequently the fuller our knowledge of facts and of their connections the more difficult to conceive alternatives; the clearer and more exact the terms – or categories – in which we conceive and describe the world, the more fixed our world structure, the less ‘free’ acts seem. To know these limits, both of imagination and, ultimately, of thought itself, is to come face to face with the ‘inexorable’ unifying pattern of the world; to realise our identity with it, to submit to it, is to find truth and peace. This is not mere oriental fatalism, nor the mechanistic determinism of the celebrated German materialists of the day, Büchner and Vogt, or Moleschott, admired so deeply by the revolutionary ‘nihilists’ of Tolstoy’s generation in Russia; nor is it a yearning for mystical illumination or integration. It is scrupulously empirical, rational, tough-minded and realistic. But its emotional cause is a passionate desire for a monistic vision of life on the part of a fox bitterly intent upon seeing in the manner of a hedgehog.</p>

Both looked for a harmonious universe, but everywhere found war and disorder, which no attempt to cheat, however heavily disguised, could even begin to hide; and so, in a condition of final despair, offered to throw away the terrible weapons of criticism with which both, but particularly Tolstoy, were over-generously endowed, in favour of the single great vision, something too indivisibly simple and remote from normal intellectual processes to be assailable by the instruments of reason, and therefore, perhaps, offering a path to peace and salvation.</p>

No greater poet than Dante, no greater philosopher than Plato, no profounder novelist than Dostoevsky exists; yet, of course, they seem to me to have been hedgehogs, and although I do think that they were fanatical unitarians – and that this can lead to disastrous consequences in social, personal and political life – this is the price that may be paid for forms of genius which may well be profounder than any other. I may have more personal sympathy with foxes; I may think that they are politically more enlightened, tolerant and humane; but this does not imply they are otherwise more valuable – if such comparisons of incommensurables make sense at all.</p>

Some analysts saw evidence of a broader manufacturing decay that started in steel, then afflicted cars, and was now spreading to high-tech industries. In 1987, Nobel Prize−winning MIT economist Robert Solow, who pioneered the study of productivity and economic growth, argued that the chip industry suffered from an “unstable structure,” with employees job hopping between firms and companies declining to invest in their workers. Prominent economist Robert Reich lamented the “paper entrepreneurialism” in Silicon Valley, which he thought focused too much on the search for prestige and affluence rather than technical advances.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">As Bill Perry watched the Persian Gulf War unfold, he knew laser-guided bombs were just one of dozens of military systems that had been revolutionized by integrated circuits, enabling better surveillance, communication, and computing power. The Persian Gulf War was the first major test of Perry’s “offset strategy,” which had been devised after the Vietnam War but never deployed in a sizeable battle. In the years after Vietnam, the U.S. military had talked about its new capabilities, but many people didn’t take them seriously. Military leaders like General William Westmoreland, who commanded American forces in Vietnam, promised that future battlefields would be automated. But the Vietnam War had gone disastrously despite America’s wide technological advantage over the North Vietnamese.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">To many people in Silicon Valley, Sanders’s romantic attachment to fabs seemed as out of touch as his macho swagger. The new class of CEOs who took over America’s semiconductor firms in the 2000s and 2010s tended to speak the language of MBAs as well as PhDs, chatting casually about capex and margins with Wall Street analysts on quarterly earnings calls. By most measures this new generation of executive talent was far more professional than the chemists and physicists who’d built Silicon Valley. But they often seemed stale in comparison to the giants who preceded them. An era of wild wagers on impossible technologies was being superseded by something more organized, professionalized, and rationalized. Bet-the-house gambles were replaced by calculated risk management. It was hard to escape the sense that something was lost in the process.</p>

The treasure, they discover, is buried under a headstone in a huge Civil War cemetery. Unfortunately, they have no idea which headstone. Having earlier taken the precaution of emptying Wallach’s revolver, Eastwood turns to him and utters the immortal lines: ‘You see, in this world there’s two kinds of people, my friend. Those with loaded guns. And those who dig. You dig.’ This is a modern example of an ancient truth. For most of history, life has been hierarchical. A few have enjoyed the privileges that come from monopolizing violence. Everyone else has dug.</p>

Though its theory was hierarchical – indeed, like John Buchan, Victorian racial theorists ranked mankind according to inherited levels of intelligence – its practice was to delegate considerable power to local rulers and private networks. Unlike Napoleon’s short-lived European empire, the British Empire was not run by a micro-managing genius, but by a club of gentlemanly amateurs, whose seemingly effortless superiority depended on the unsung strivings of local agents and native collaborators.</p>

High-modernist planning wreaked all kinds of havoc in its heyday, from the collectivization of Soviet agriculture to the building of Brasilia and the compulsory ujamaa villages in Tanzania. Yet it could always survive such catastrophes, if only because their effect was to kill off any kind of opposition.

On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear … Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions … Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications … We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.

          <p class="highlight__text">When emerging technologies that give rise to wealth do not advance the broader public interest, trouble often follows. Put differently, the decadence of a culture or civilization, and indeed its ruling class, will be forgiven only if that culture is capable of delivering economic growth and security for the public. In this way, the willingness of the engineering and scientific communities to come to the aid of the nation has been vital not only to the legitimacy of the private sector but to the durability of political institutions across the West.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">A generation of founders cloaked themselves in the rhetoric of lofty and ambitious purpose—indeed their rallying cry to change the world has grown lifeless from overuse—but often raised enormous amounts of capital and hired legions of talented engineers merely to build photo-sharing apps and chat interfaces for the modern consumer. A skepticism of government work and national ambition took hold in the Valley. The grand, collectivist experiments of the earlier part of the twentieth century were discarded in favor of a narrow attentiveness to the desires and needs of the individual. The market rewarded shallow engagement with the potential of technology, as startup after startup catered to the whims of late capitalist culture without any interest in constructing the technical infrastructure that would address our most significant challenges as a nation. The age of social media platforms and food delivery apps had arrived. Medical breakthroughs, education reform, and military advances would have to wait.</p>

This next era of conflict will be won or lost with software. One age of deterrence, the atomic age, is ending, and a new era of deterrence built on AI is set to begin. The risk, however, is that we think we have already won.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">The ability to develop the tools required to deploy force against an opponent, combined with a credible threat to use such force, is often the foundation of any effective negotiation with an adversary. The underlying cause of our cultural hesitation to openly pursue technical superiority may be our collective sense that we have already won. But the certainty with which many believed that history had come to an end, and that Western liberal democracy had emerged in permanent victory after the struggles of the twentieth century, is as dangerous as it is pervasive.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">“To be coercive, violence has to be anticipated,” he wrote in the 1960s as the United States grappled with its military escalation in Vietnam. “The power to hurt is bargaining power. To exploit it is diplomacy—vicious diplomacy, but diplomacy.” The virtue of Schelling’s version of realism was its unsentimental disentanglement of the moral from the strategic. As he made clear, “War is always a bargaining process.” Before one engages with the justice or injustice of a policy, it is necessary to understand one’s leverage or lack thereof in a negotiation, armed or otherwise. The contemporary approach to international affairs too often assumes, either explicitly or implicitly, that the correctness of one’s views from a moral or ethical perspective precludes the need to engage with the more distasteful and fundamental question of relative power with respect to a geopolitical opponent, and specifically which party has a superior ability to inflict harm on the other.</p>

Wanting, whether it’s intimacy with another person or a new pair of shoes, is kind of beautiful. I like that we have those ever-renewing desires.”</p>

The individuals at the periphery of a group, who often have the latest and most valuable information regarding the suitability of potential nesting sites, and can take into account shifting conditions, are the ones who cast their ballots by dancing for the group. The swarm organizes itself around the problem at hand.</p>

The impulse—indeed rush—to smooth over any hint of conflict within businesses and government agencies is misguided, leaving many with the misimpression that a life of ease awaits and rewarding those whose principal desire is the approval of others.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, a talented graduate could perhaps join Goldman Sachs, which was a pioneer of partnership compensation models, or perhaps a white-shoe law firm, where attorneys shared the profits, and risk, of their work. But those experiments have essentially withered; such firms still attract talented and ambitious minds, but they are paid salaries, often high ones, but salaries nonetheless. The upside of the endeavors and creative energy of labor is captured by the capitalists.</p>

But it is thin and can wither under even the slightest scrutiny. The legions of young founders have for decades now routinely claimed that they aspire to change the world. Yet such claims have grown meaningless from overuse. This cloak of idealism was put on in order to relieve these young founders of the need to develop anything approaching a more substantial worldview.

Philosopher and mathematician Alfred North Whitehead stated this principle over a century ago:           It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. (Alfred North Whitehead, 1911.)</p>

We may not have to remember all the details of the information stored away for us, but we will have to remember that it is there, that it needs to be redisplayed at the appropriate time for use or for reminding.</p>

It was a simple mental exercise. Look at the facts without judgment: Havelock was an Earther. Havelock was in a portside bar again and looking for a fight. Havelock was his partner. Statement after statement, fact after fact, facet after facet. He didn’t try to put them in order or make some kind of narrative out of them; that would all come later. Now it was enough to wash the day’s cases out of his head and get ready for the immediate situation. By the time the tube reached his station, he felt centered.

          <p class="highlight__text">PHILOSOPHER: Here, it would do well to recall that quote from Erich Fromm: ‘Respect means the concern that the other person should grow and unfold as he is.’ Without negating anything, or forcing anything, one accepts and values the person as he is. In other words, one protects, and one has concern for, another person’s dignity. Do you see where that concrete first step lies? YOUTH: No. Where? PHILOSOPHER: This is a quite logical conclusion. It lies in having concern for other people’s concerns. YOUTH: Other people’s concerns? PHILOSOPHER: For example, the children enjoy playing in a way that is completely beyond your understanding. They get absorbed with utterly inane, childish toys. Sometimes, they read books that are offensive to public order and morals and indulge in video games. You know what I am referring to, yes? YOUTH: Sure. I see such things almost every day. PHILOSOPHER: There are many parents and educators who disapprove and try to give them things that are more ‘useful’ or ‘worthwhile’. They advise against such activities, confiscate the books and toys and allow the children only what has been determined to have value. The parent does this ‘for the child’s sake’, of course. Even so, one must regard this as an act that is completely lacking in respect and that only increases the parent’s distance from the child. Because it is negating the child’s natural concerns.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">PHILOSOPHER: When you look at your speech and conduct, and at other people’s speech and conduct, think about the goals that are hidden in them. This is a basic way of thinking in Adlerian psychology. YOUTH: I know—it’s ‘teleology’, right? PHILOSOPHER: Would you give a simple explanation of it? YOUTH: I will try. Regardless of what may have occurred in the past, nothing is determined by it. It does not matter if there are past traumas, either. Because human beings are not driven by past ‘causes’ but live according to present ‘goals’. Suppose, for example, the person who says, ‘My home environment was bad and that’s why I have a dark personality.’ This is a life lie. The truth is that person first has the goal of ‘I don’t want to get hurt by getting involved with other people,’ and in order to realise that goal, they choose a ‘dark personality’ that doesn’t get involved with anyone. Then, as an excuse for having themselves chosen such a personality, they bring up their past home environment. It’s something like that, right? PHILOSOPHER: Yes. Please continue. YOUTH: In other words, we are not creatures who are determined by past events. Rather, we determine our own lives according to the meaning we give to those events. PHILOSOPHER: That’s right. YOUTH: And then, you said something like this: no matter what has occurred in your life until now, it has no bearing at all on how you live your life from now on. And that you, living here and now, are the one who decides your own life. So, did I get anything wrong?</p>

One does it without receiving gratitude. YOUTH: So one accepts that loneliness? PHILOSOPHER: Yes.

One finds happiness in the feeling of contribution. That is the only way.</p>

Suppose a child asks, ‘Can I go and play at my friend’s place?’ There are parents who will grant permission, ‘Of course you can,’ and then set the condition, ‘Once you’ve done your homework.’ And there are others who will simply prohibit their children from going out to play. Both are forms of conduct that put the child in a position of dependence and irresponsibility. Instead, teach the child by saying, ‘That is something you can decide on your own.’ Teach that one’s own life and one’s everyday actions are things that one determines oneself. And if deciding things requires certain ingredients—knowledge and experience, for example—then provide them. That is how educators should be.</p>

That is to say, he thought of work as a task quite directly linked to survival. YOUTH: Hmm. Well, that’s rather banal. It’s just, ‘Work so that you can eat?’ PHILOSOPHER: Yes. When we think of surviving, of eking out a living, the fact that we humans must engage in some kind of labour is a self-evident truth.</p>

A relationship, not of cooperating because one likes that person, but of having to cooperate whether one likes it or not. You can think of it that way. YOUTH: Fascinating! No, I mean it, this is wonderful! I’m finally getting the work relationship. Division of labour is necessary for living, and mutual trust is necessary in order to carry it out. And there is no alternative. We cannot live alone, and not trusting is not an option. We have no choice but to build relationships … That’s how it is, right? PHILOSOPHER: Yes. It truly is a life task.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">“Where in the annals of Western philosophy could we find a sharper antithesis to [the] restriction of ethical inquiry to a carefully selected, rigorously trained elite than in the Socrates of Plato’s earlier dialogues?”13 That’s the right way to think about Socrates; for apart from whatever specific teachings may be attributed to him, he himself was an egalitarian character—poor, ugly, and happy to talk about the most important questions with anyone at all.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">Using the Socratic method yourself isn’t easier than using it in conversation. In fact it’s a good deal harder. The defects in someone else’s views are no trouble to spot. Seeing them in your own is a much tougher challenge. It is like exercise. It’s easier with a trainer, but possible to do well without one. And Socratic questioning is like physical exercise in an additional sense: it’s good for you, but doesn’t feel good when you’re doing it; in fact it’s often good for you just to the extent that it’s uncomfortable. That is why nothing is more common than intellectual obesity.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">Socrates particularly likes to question beliefs that his discussion partners take for granted. This shows another good reason to want an adversary within your thinking. It breaks your sense of identification with the views you hold. We all have false beliefs about the world or ourselves—views that wouldn’t withstand Socratic scrutiny and don’t usually get it. They’re half-conscious ideas that we take for granted and that are kept out of view. Socratic questioning takes off the camouflage. A belief that had seemed too obvious or sacred to get grilled is put on the stand. For as long as the questioning lasts, the belief isn’t so much a part of you. It had been talking through you; now you are talking to it. Adversarial thinking separates us from our prejudices and expectations.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">Cumulative consistency is more than reassuring. It leads to enlargement of your knowledge and confidence in it; it snowballs. In this way the elenchus helps along the formation of the self. It causes you to figure out what your moral conscience is made of. There is a conflict in your views; you have to decide which to keep and which to drop. It is like an inner tournament with winning and losing ideas. You understand yourself better after many rounds of it.17 The Socratic method thus helps toward fulfillment of the instruction inscribed over the entrance to the Temple of Apollo at Delphi: know thyself.18 This theory also explains how Socrates can claim that he doesn’t know anything and yet still have beliefs about hard questions—that doing wrong is worse than suffering it, or whatever else. Those beliefs aren’t quite things he knows. They just seem true to him because they’ve survived all testing so far. An argument, or an adversary, might still appear and be sharp enough to show that the claims Socrates makes don’t hold together in some way. So if consistency is the test of truth, it never settles a question once and for all. It forces you to hold views provisionally, and to always be in a state of search for more confirmation or refutation.</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">Callicles says it’s good if you manage to do a wrong without getting caught. Socrates gets him to agree to some other points that end up conflicting with that one, then gives this warning if Callicles can’t find a way out of the argument put in front of him: SOCRATES. If you leave it unrefuted, then I swear to you by the divine dog of the Egyptians that it’ll cause friction between you and Callicles, Callicles; there’ll be discord within you your whole life. And yet, my friend, in my opinion it’s preferable for me to be a musician with an out-of-tune lyre or a choir leader with a cacophonous choir, and it’s preferable for almost everyone in the world to find my beliefs misguided and wrong, rather than for just one person—me—to contradict and clash with myself. Gorgias 482bc This is stronger language than most of us would now use to talk about being inconsistent. It follows from the distinct way that Socrates thinks about living well. When people believe two things that can’t both be right, they’re half-asleep or half-mad. They don’t actually think anything in particular. They just imagine that they do. They lack knowledge of who they are, and so are ridiculous without realizing it.</p>

How Mill put it: The majority of mankind would need to be much better cultivated than has ever yet been the case, before they can be asked to place such reliance in their own power of estimating arguments, as to give up practical principles in which they have been born and bred and which are the basis of much of the existing order of the world, at the first argumentative attack which they are not capable of logically resisting.3</p>

A lot of academic work now described as philosophy does fit that description. But on a Socratic view, philosophy is relevant to just about everything, high and low. It isn’t a set of problems that some care about and some don’t. Philosophy means thinking carefully about whether you believe all that you say and whether it’s true.

But they sometimes can be perceived without words. It may be that justice, for example, can’t be captured by a definition. But it can be encircled by the close failure of many efforts at definition. Instead of that result seeming to be a mess and therefore a failure, the mess is the thing sought. The goal of the effort at reasoning isn’t a conclusion based on the reasoning but a grasp of something larger.

          <p class="highlight__text">Socratic philosophy treats eudaimonia as its final goal. That word will be translated here as happiness, which is most common.1 Some say eudaimonia is better translated as well-being, or as living well. The issue arises because in English it’s natural to think of happiness as a subjective state: it means feeling good. But eudaimonia has an objective aspect. It implies a judgment from the outside that someone is doing well. It means a good life, not just a good mood; a good life is one to which felt happiness is the right response. People can enjoy themselves in despicable ways and so not be described as happy in this Greek sense even if they seem to be having a good time. The opposite of happy, on this view, wouldn’t be gloomy or depressed; it would be a word like wretched or pitiable. This way of thinking about happiness sometimes takes adjustment now (and the adjustment is useful), but it seemed ordinary in ancient times. Socrates treats the achievement of happiness, in the sense just described, as the purpose of life. Everybody wants to live well; if a philosophy leads to that result, nothing more need be said in defense of it.</p>

The rest of the world are of opinion … that a man may have knowledge, and yet that the knowledge which is in him may be overmastered by anger, or pleasure, or pain, or love, or perhaps by fear,—just as if knowledge were a slave, and might be dragged about anyhow. Now is that your view? or do you think that knowledge is a noble and commanding thing, which cannot be overcome, and will not allow a man, if he only knows the difference of good and evil, to do anything which is contrary to knowledge, but that wisdom will have strength to help him? Protagoras 352bc Socrates evidently takes the latter view: if you seem to have a failure of will, it’s really a failure of knowledge. There is no such thing as akrasia.</p>

No.… Ignorance of what is and is not to be feared must be cowardice. [Protagoras] nodded. Well, courage is the opposite of cowardice. He agreed. And knowledge of what is and is not to be feared is the opposite of ignorance of these things. He nodded again. Which is cowardice. Here he assented with great reluctance.

But the question remains: At what point do any of these features suddenly take control of our minds and actions?</p>

          <p class="highlight__text">Boredom is bad for the same reasons pain is bad. Both indicate suffering. Both indicate a problem that needs solving. And neither is a virtue in its own right. We wouldn’t arbitrarily expose a child to pain with the argument that pain is an inevitable part of life that they need to “learn to deal with.” Such cruelty teaches children that, not only are we indifferent to their suffering, but they should accept their suffering as well. Instead, when a child comes to us in pain, we always investigate why, partly for our own peace of mind, but also to give the child context to understand the pain. When we ourselves understand that the injury is minor, we explain to the child that it will heal, and this understanding is soothing. And of course we take a few steps to mitigate the pain and prevent it from happening again. We should apply the same basic process for all suffering, including boredom. All suffering is caused by some form of ignorance, and it can be mitigated and outright prevented by some form of knowledge. All of parenting can be summarized as supplying the child with the knowledge to reduce their own suffering.</p>

But that’s not to say we pretend they are totally free from constraints. We want them to operate within the constraints of the natural world. Indeed, they have no choice but to accept gravity and the hardness of concrete. And we want them to operate within some of the constraints of the interpersonal world. Specifically, there are two kinds of good interpersonal constraints: Other people’s boundaries. We don’t want kids to think they can demand anything they want from others. Constraints that they accept voluntarily, such as the rules of a game or conventions of politeness. In general, we want kids to understand the natural world, to respect other people’s boundaries, and to accept the interpersonal constraints they understand, and reject those that they don’t.</p>

It’s relatively common for even the most seemingly well-adjusted college freshman to fall apart in some way, drop out, and think themselves to have started real life as a failure, saddled with debt and disappointment. Relative to this dramatic phase change that we all take for granted, is it so radical to wean a child off of rules completely prior to leaving the home?</p>

But with human knowledge, the problems are not limited to survival—they can be about anything, either in the real world or imagined. And instead of mutation, the engine of variation is conjecture, or creative guesswork. Selection consists of, first, criticizing all of our candidate guesses and, second, choosing only the guess that seems to work best. Often, this involves actually trying out the guess in the real world to see if it solves the problem in question.</p>

On the contrary, knowledge creation is an entirely egalitarian enterprise—anyone’s conjecture might solve the problem at hand, anyone’s criticism might be reason to choose one path over another. Kids’ ideas are just as valid as adults’, and they should be taken seriously and accounted for in any solution to any conflict.</p>

This may explain why many adults are so quick to crack down on things that kids find particularly enjoyable. Having an outsized amount of fun almost universally signals a straying from the static norms. Conformity is almost never wildly fun. This is especially true when the source of enjoyment is new, such as a novel form of food, technology, or media. A simple rule of stasis is to be watchful and stamp out excessive enjoyment among children.</p>

Education could focus on real-world training around genuine interests in a way that is guided by providing value to others. College graduates, on the other hand, often enter adulthood hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. This debt forces them to narrow their options to uninspiring jobs rather than taking risks on starting new ventures that might solve problems in novel ways and raise the prosperity of everyone. Instead, college graduates are incentivized to play it safe, to never experiment, and to accept a middling quality of life. This overall outlook—a life of low expectations, where the main virtues are persistence and conformity rather than dynamism—gets passed onto their children as a tragic holdover from the static societies of yesteryear.</p>
